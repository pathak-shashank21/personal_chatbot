Contradictory believes of \nconsidering Pluto a full-fledged planet or not is an \ninteresting discussion that made one thing certain: The \nobject is shrouded in mystery, and we don't have a \ncomplete picture of what it would be like to live there. \nWe've never been to anywhere like Pluto.  \nUnmanned exploratory missions can collect data but \nthey cannot detect weird microscopic life-forms that are \nnot in our database yet. At least not yet. They are not \nprogrammed to recognize what might be lurking below \nthe surface of Charon, or beneath the icy murky seas of \nPluto. Astronaut missions are expensive and riskier than \n\n67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Guadalajara, Mexico, 26-30 September 2016.  \nCopyright ©2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \nIAC-16-A5,IP,10,x35345                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 2 of 6 \nunmanned missions but they are absolutely vital for the \nsuccess of our exploration program.  \nSo in this paper, the propaganda is to explore the \npossibilities of a manned mission to Pluto and study \nabout the major celestial figures in Pluto’s orbit and \nKuiper Belt. \n \n2. Pluto  \nPluto is the largest known dwarf planet in the solar \nsystem and was once considered the ninth and most \ndistant planet from the sun. Beyond the gas giant \nNeptune lies an entire region of space filled with icy \nbodies known as the Kuiper Belt, of which Pluto is the \nlargest \nknown \nmember \nof. \nIn \n2006, \nPluto \nwas reclassified as a dwarf planet, a change widely \nconsidered as a demotion. This question of Pluto's \ncelestial status attracted a lot of controversies and stirred \na debate in the scientific community, and among the \ngeneral public as well.  \nLaunched on January 19, 2006, NASA's New Horizons \nspacecraft flashed past Pluto on July 14, 2015. From \nPluto’s unusual heart-shaped region to its extended \natmosphere and intriguing moons, New Horizons has \nrevealed a degree of diversity and complexity in the \nPluto system that few expected in the frigid outer \nreaches of the solar system. \n \n3.  Composition & Structure \n3.1 Atmospheric Composition - Nitrogen, methane. \nObservations by New Horizons reveals that \natmosphere of Pluto extends as far as sixteen \nhundred kilometers (1,000 miles) above the \nsurface of the dwarf planet. \n \n3.2 Magnetic Field - Although unknown about the \nexistence of Pluto’s magnetic field, the slow \nrotation and small size of the dwarf planet \nsuggest it has little to no such field. \n \n3.3 Chemical Composition - Estimating a mixture \nof 30 percent water ice and 70 percent rock is \nquite probable. \n \n3.4 Internal Structure - Pluto probably has a rocky \ncore enclosed within a mantle of water ice \nalong with more exotic ices such as carbon \nmonoxide, methane and nitrogen ice coating \nthe entire surface. \n \n4. Orbit and Rotation \nPluto's rotation is retrograde compared to the other \nworlds of our solar systems. It spins from east to \nwest. \n4.1 Average distance from the sun - 5,906,380,000 \nkilometers (3,670,050,000 miles) which is \n39.482 times the distance of Earth. \n4.2 Perihelion (closest distance from the sun) - \n4,436,820,000 kilometers (2,756,902,000miles) \nwhich is 30.171 times the distance of Earth \n4.3 Aphelion (farthest approach to the sun) - \n7,375,930,000 kilometers (4,583,190,000miles) \nwhich is 48.481 times the distance of Earth \n \nMaking \nthis \nmission \nsuccessful, \nNASA's \nmost \nimpressive achievements till date coined a question – \nWhat Next? \n \n5. Sending Man to Pluto \nThe next logical step for further expansion of our \ntechnically bounded horizons would be of a robotic \nPluto lander followed by manned mission to Pluto. New \nHorizons is currently the fastest spacecraft that has ever \nleft Earth. It crossed Jupiter’s orbit the very next year of \nits launch and had travelled nearly a million miles in a \nday. Still it took about 9.5 years for the spacecraft to \nreach Pluto and its moons. Organizing a manned \nmission will require additional 10 years for their return \nback. Food, air, water, fuel, exercise and life in zero \ngravity for 20 years would make any team going \nincapable of living back on the Earth for a longer period \nof time after their return from the mission. In order to \novercome that, time duration of the mission needs to be \ncompensated. \nThe most advanced propulsion systems in our \ntechnological grasp today requires 10 to 15 years for \ndelivering 1.6-kilogram (3.5 lbs.) spacecraft in Pluto’s \norbit. The International Space Station (ISS) has been \ncontinuously orbiting around the Earth, manned, since \nOct. 31, 2000. There is, of course, a wide difference \nbetween the ISS and a manned Pluto spacecraft \nincluding the lack of significant propulsion. The ISS has \nbeen resupplied and occupied by crews rotating from \nEarth several times per annum for the past 14 years. \nWhereas, astronauts traveling to Pluto would be utterly \nisolated with self-contained life supporting systems. The \nlongest period of a human spending time in space has \nbeen recorded of 437 days and no self-contained, closed \nbiosphere has the capacity of holding human life for \nmore than two years.  \nThe only known spacecraft propulsion technology \nthat is capable of delivering a multihundred-ton manned \nspacecraft to Pluto within a year has been laying around \nsince 1950s and is titled Project Orion. The concept of \nthis technology is to propel the spacecraft by exploding \nthousands of small nuclear bombs fixated behind it. \nEach detonation drives a\"",
