    "1.1\nBackground and Motivation\nThe Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) are a set of five angles: Polar Motion\n(PM) represented by xp and yp, phase of rotation (UT1-UTC), and Celestial Polar\nOffsets (CPO) denoted as dX and dY. The PM, which has an annual motion and\nChandlerian-free wobble with a period of 433 days, is the motion of the Earth’s\npole relative to the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS). The phase of\nrotation, known as UT1-UTC, represents the difference between the fundamental\nform of Universal Time 1 (UT1) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). (See Figure",

    "1. Introduction\nFigure 1.2 demonstrates how the Earth’s rotation and orientation are influenced by\nboth gravitational torques exerted by external masses, such as the moon and the\nsun, and by geophysical processes like mantle convection in Earth’s interior, mass\nredistribution in the atmosphere, oceans, and hydrosphere, and angular momentum\nexchange within the Earth-moon system.\nFigure 1.2: Earth Motion Factors by NASA\nTraditional geodetic surveillance of these variations hinges on sophisticated techniques.\nVery Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) (Schuh and B¨ohm (2010)) gauges the\nEarth’s rotation by measuring the time difference between the arrival of radio waves\nfrom distant quasars to telescopes located thousands of kilometers apart (Schuh and\nBehrend (2012)).

This encompasses a multi-faceted\ntechnical exploration that advances from data acquisition to model optimization and\npredictive validation (Luzum (2010)). The specific technical objectives are as follows:\nDevelopment of a Comprehensive ML Model\nThe thesis sets out to architect and fine-tune ML model complex enough to encapsu-\nlate the intricacies embedded in historical EOP datasets. This task involves:\n• Curating a rich dataset from reputable EOP data repositories, ensuring a repre-\nsentative compilation of variability in Earth’s rotation and orientation.\n• Preprocessing and feature engineering to structure the data effectively for ML\nconsumption, involving noise reduction, normalization, and trend decomposition.\n• Exploring various ML architectures, including but not limited to neural networks,\nsupport vector machines, and ensemble methods, to assess their suitability for\ntemporal and non-linear pattern recognition within EOP data.\n• Tuning hyperparameters and regularizing the ML models to enhance their\npredictive accuracy and prevent overfitting to the historical data.\nValidation of Model Predictions\nTo establish the ML model as a reliable tool for EOP forecasting, rigorous validation\nmechanisms will be employed:\n• Implementing cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model’s performance on\nunseen data segments, thereby assuring the model’s robustness and repeatability.\n4",

The\nresulting comparative analysis between machine-learned and traditional methods will\nunderscore the transformative potential that contemporary ML techniques bear on\nthe field of Earth science.",
    "1.3\nState of the Art\nIn the past, the prediction of Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) has depended on\nthe utilization of VLBI (Schuh and B¨ohm (2010)), SLR (Combrinck (2010)), GNSS\n(Schuh and B¨ohm (2013)), and other space geodetic techniques. These techniques\nenable accurate measurements of the Earth’s rotation and orientation by monitoring\nquasars and satellites, allowing for direct observations of variations in EOP (Charlot\net al. (2020)), (Schuh and Behrend (2012)). The IERS has a crucial role in collecting\nand distributing these observations, providing a standardized reference for EOP\npredictions (Luzum (2010)).\nPhenomena like the exchange of angular momentum between the atmosphere and\noceans, as well as variations in the water cycle, can cause disturbances in Earth’s\nrotational motion. By integrating these geophysical insights into machine learning\nmodels, either as characteristics or by modifying the model’s structure, it is pos-\nsible to enhance the accuracy and resilience of predictions. The works cited are\n(Kiani Shahvandi et al. (2023)) and (Luzum (2010)).The Earth Orientation Center\n(EOC) of the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)\npublishes daily Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) values in the C04 series. These\nvalues are important for a range of applications, such as astronomy, geodesy, and\ntimekeeping, extending beyond the scope of natural disaster mitigation. Although",
    "1.4. Structure of the thesis\n5\nvarious prediction techniques have been developed, accurately predicting short-term\nEarth Orientation Parameters (EOP) is still a difficulty. This highlights the need for\nmethodological enhancements to meet the needs of the Global Geodetic Observing\nSystem (GGOS) (Schuh et al. (2002)), (Kalarus et al. (2010)) and (Dick and Thaller\n(2020)).\nThe progression of machine learning (ML) has brought out new approaches in EOP\nprediction, which provide a challenge to conventional models by utilizing data-\ndriven methodologies capable of capturing intricate, non-linear patterns that are\ninherent in the EOP time series. Neural networks, specifically LSTM networks,\nhave demonstrated potential in accurately representing time-based sequences with\nextended dependencies, rendering them appropriate for challenges involving the\nprediction of EOPs (Dhar et al. (2022)), (Wang et al. (2019)), (Kumar Dubey et al.\n(2021)), (Huang et al. (2022)), (Sirisha et al. (2022)) and (Khaira et al. (2020)). The\ncapacity of machine learning algorithms to acquire knowledge from past data and\napply it to new, unfamiliar data provides a notable benefit in forecasting variations\nin EOP across different geophysical conditions (Gou et al. (2023)) and (Albeladi\net al. (2023)).\nA notable advancement in the analytical techniques for EOP prediction is the applica-\ntion of SSA. SSA has been instrumental in decomposing time series into constituent\ncomponents, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. This\nmethod’s integration into EOP forecasting has enriched the predictive models with\nenhanced analytical depth, enabling more nuanced and accurate predictions of EOP\nvariations (Modiri (2021)).",

    "2.1\nMotion of Earth\nThe Earth’s motion, both in its orbit around the Sun and its rotation on its axis, is\na foundational aspect of our planet’s dynamics, deeply influencing various terrestrial\nand celestial phenomena. As the third planet in the solar system, Earth follows an\nelliptical orbit around the Sun, completing one revolution annually. This revolution,\ncoupled with the Earth’s axial tilt of 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane, leads\nto the cyclical nature of seasons.\nSimultaneously, the Earth rotates on its axis, an imaginary line connecting the North\nand South Poles, once every 24 hours. This rotation is responsible for the daily cycle\nof day and night and contributes to the apparent westward motion of the Sun, Moon,\nand stars across the sky. The tilt of the Earth’s axis also means that the Sun’s path,\nas observed from Earth, appears to traverse a tilted trajectory relative to this axis.\nThis phenomenon is what gives us the varying lengths of day and night throughout\nthe year.\nThe Earth’s orbital path projects onto the celestial sphere as the ecliptic. The\npoints where this path intersects the celestial equator are known as the equinoxes.\nConversely, the solstices – the summer solstice around June 21st and the winter\nsolstice around December 21st – mark the extremes of the Sun’s apparent path on\nthe celestial sphere.\nA critical aspect of Earth’s motion is precession, the gradual shift in the direction of\nthe Earth’s axis of rotation. Influenced primarily by gravitational forces from the\nSun and the Moon, this slow movement alters the orientation of the Earth’s axis\nover a cycle of approximately 26,000 years. This precession movement means that\nthe celestial poles and equators are not fixed in location but gradually shift, affecting\nthe celestial coordinates of astronomical objects. As a result, the reference frame for\ncelestial coordinates, traditionally tied to the position of the vernal equinox. The\n8",

Geodesy Fundamentals and Related Work\ncommonly used reference frame today is the Equinox J2000.0, which is based on the\nequinox and mean equator positions as of January 1, 2000 12:00:00.\nUnderstanding and monitoring Earth’s rotation and orbital movement is crucial for\nvarious scientific and practical applications. It is foundational for timekeeping, navi-\ngation, and the establishment of global reference frames. The continuous observation\nof these motions provides insights into the interactions between the Earth’s compo-\nnents, such as the atmosphere, oceans, and solid Earth, and the internal dynamics\ninvolving the Earth’s core and mantle (Chao et al. (1996)). Today, precise space\ngeodetic techniques like VLBI (Schuh and Behrend (2012)), SLR/ LLR, GNSS, and\nring laser gyroscopes are employed to measure these movements with high accuracy,\ncontributing to a comprehensive understanding of Earth’s intricate motions within\nthe solar system.",
    "2.2\nInternational Celestial Reference System (ICRS)\nThe International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) as described in IERS Technical\nnotes by (Petit and Luzum (2010)) is a highly precise and stable celestial coordinate\nsystem that serves as a foundation for modern astronomical observations and data.\nIt is based on the positions of distant extragalactic objects, primarily quasars, which\nare considered to have negligible proper motions, making them ideal for defining a\nfixed frame of reference. The ICRS is realized through the ICRF, which provides a\nset of precise coordinates for these objects.\nThe ICRF’s establishment and ongoing refinement are crucial for maintaining the\naccuracy of the ICRS. The first realization of the ICRF (ICRF1) (Ma et al. (1998))\nwas constructed in 1995 using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to measure\nthe positions of 212 defining extragalactic radio sources. The second realization,\nICRF2 (Fey et al.

It expanded the number of sources to over\n3,000, significantly reducing the formal uncertainties in position measurements and\nincreasing the frame’s overall stability by January 1, 2010.\nThe International Astronomical Union (IAU) adapted to ICRF3 and has further\nenhanced its accuracy by containing 4,536 objects at S and X bands as of January 1,\n2019 as shown in the Figure 2.1",

These points\nare anchored at geodetic observatories equipped with sophisticated space geodesy\ntechniques such as VLBI, SLR, GNSS including GPS, and DORIS. The ITRF’s\nconstruction entails a sophisticated combination of data from these diverse geodetic\ntechniques, necessitating the establishment of highly precise local ties at co-location\nsites to integrate the disparate data streams into a singular, cohesive reference frame.\nOver the years, the ITRF has undergone numerous revisions, each iteration marked\nby advancements in data quality, network density, and analytical methodologies.\nSuccessive versions, including ITRF88, ITRF2000, ITRF2005, and ITRF2008, have\nsystematically enhanced the frame’s accuracy and stability. These enhancements\nreflect the cumulative improvements in geodetic instrumentation, data processing\ntechniques, and the expanding global network of geodetic observatories.

The EOP consist of five key components: two polar motion coordinates\n(xp, yp), the difference in Universal Time (UT1-UTC), and celestial pole offsets\n(dX, dY ). These components reflect the Earth’s irregular rotation and orientation in\nspace, influenced by various geophysical and astronomical factors.\nThe polar motion (PM), xp and yp, describe the shifting of the Earth’s rotation axis\nrelative to its surface, encompassing the Chandler wobble with a period of about 433\ndays and an annual wobble. The UT1-UTC component, a measure of the Earth’s\nrotation angle, is vital for timekeeping and navigation, correlating with the length\nof the day and affected by factors such as tidal forces and changes in the Earth’s\nmoment of inertia (Capitaine and Wallace (2006)). CPO, dX and dY , represent\nthe corrections to the IAU precession-nutation model, accounting for the small but\nsignificant discrepancies between the observed and modeled motion of the celestial\npole, influenced by phenomena such as the Free Core Nutation (FCN) (Dehant and\nMathews (2015)).\nThe transformation matrix, incorporating these EOP, is mathematically represented\nas\n[GCRS] = Q(t) · R(t) · W(t) · [ITRS]\n(2.1)\nwhere Q(t) includes the celestial pole offsets, R(t) represents Earth’s rotation, and\nW(t) describes the terrestrial pole offsets (Schuh and B¨ohm (2013)). The precise\ndetermination of these parameters is predominantly achieved through Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry (VLBI), along with contributions from other space geodetic\ntechniques like GNSS and SLR.

Originating from the groundbreaking work in\n1997 by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) and subsequently refined by numerous\nresearchers, LSTMs have garnered widespread adoption due to their exceptional\nperformance across a myriad of problems.\nOne of the critical challenges in sequential data processing is the need to remember\ninformation over long periods. Traditional RNNs often falter in this aspect due to a\nphenomenon known as ”vanishing gradients,” where the network loses the ability to\nlearn connections between events separated by long time intervals.\nLSTMs address this challenge with a unique architecture that includes components\ncalled ”gates.” These gates control the flow of information, allowing the network to\nretain or discard data as needed. This mechanism enables LSTMs to ”remember”\nrelevant past information and ”forget” irrelevant data, making them exceptionally\nadept at understanding long-range dependencies in the data.\nFigure 3.1: Illustration of a RNN, (Olah (2015))\nAll RNNs share a structure resembling a chain of repeating neural network modules\nshown in Figure 3.1 that in Recurring Neural Network (RNN), ”A” represents a single\nunit or cell within the network. Each cell takes an input xt at a given timestep t\n16",

    "3.1 pink circles are vector operations, yellow boxes are the trained neural network\nlayers while the lines represent the flow of information or vector transfer. The hidden\nstate ht encapsulates information learned from previous timesteps, allowing the\nnetwork to maintain a form of memory over sequential data. In the case of standard\nRNNs, this repeating module typically comprises a single layer, often employing a\nsimple structure like a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) layer(to normalize the values to be\nbetween -1 and 1). However, LSTMs exhibit a similar chain-like arrangement but\nboast a distinct architecture. Within their repeating module, LSTMs incorporate\nfour interacting layers, each playing a specialized role in information processing and\nretention. Further discussions can be found in (Deb et al. (2017)), and (Lindemann\net al. (2021)).",
    "3.1.1\nCore Components of LSTMs\nCell State At the heart of LSTMs lies the cell state Ct, acting as a conveyor belt\ncarrying information across different time steps. The cell state retains information\nover long sequences and allows selective updates through various gates.\nGates in LSTMs LSTMs employ gates to regulate the flow of information into and\nout of the cell state, consisting of four main gates:\n• Forget gate: The weights linked to the gate are important for understanding\nhow the forget gate makes its choice. The weights play an essential part when\ncalculating the significance of the inputs (current input xt and prior hidden state\nht−1 in the decision-making process of retaining or discarding information as\nshown in Figure 3.2.\nFigure 3.2: Illustration of Forget Gate, (Olah (2015))\nThe procedure can be defined mathematically as follows:\nft = σ(Wf · [ht−1, xt] + bf)\n(3.1)",
    "3.1. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\n17\nWhere:\n– ft is the output of the forget gate.\n– σ represents the sigmoid function, ensuring the output is between 0 and 1.\n– Wf are the weights associated with the forget gate, applied to the inputs.\n– [ht−1, xt] is the matrix containing information of the previous hidden state\nand the current input.\n– bf is the bias term for the forget gate.",
    "1. Decision-Making in the Forget Gate: The LSTM network adjusts the weights\nWf during training using backpropagation to decide which components of\nthe cell state are crucial to keep or discard for the task.\nA high weight assigned to a certain feature in the input or the previous\nconcealed state indicates the significance of that feature in determining\nwhether the corresponding information in the cell state should be retained.\nAs a result, the sigmoid function will produce a value closer to 1 for that\nfeature, indicating to the cell to save that information. If the weight is low\nor negative, it signifies that the feature is not significant for the current\ndecision or job. This causes the sigmoid function to produce a value closer\nto 0, leading the cell to disregard that information.",
    "2. Adaptive Learning: The weights are not fixed; they are learned and consis-\ntently adjusted when the LSTM model encounters additional input through-\nout the training phase. This enables the forget gate and the LSTM as a\nwhole to adjust to the unique attributes of the data it is being trained on,\nhence enhancing its efficiency.\n• Input gate\nFigure 3.3: Illustration of Input Gate, (Olah (2015))\n18",

    "1. Value Selection via Sigmoid Function: The sigmoid layer assesses both\nthe current input xt and the previous hidden state ht−1, assigning a value\nbetween 0 and 1 to each element in the cell state, indicating the need for\nupdating based on the new information’s relevance. This process is given\nby:\nit = σ(Wi · [ht−1, xt] + bi)\n(3.2)\nwhere it is the sigmoid layer’s output, Wi represents the weights, and bi is\nthe bias. A value close to 1 implies high relevance for an update, while a\nvalue near 0 suggests irrelevance.",
    "2. Generation of Candidate Values via Tanh Function: A tanh layer creates a\nvector of new candidate values ˜Ct, normalized between -1 and 1, suitable for\nupdating the cell state:\n˜Ct = tanh(WC · [ht−1, xt] + bC)\n(3.3)\nHere, WC and bC denote the weights and bias for this layer, respectively.\nThe cell state is updated by combining these outputs, where the sigmoid output\nit determines the addition extent of each candidate value ˜Ct to the cell state,\npost-modification by the forget gate:\nCt = ft ⊙Ct−1 + it ⊙˜Ct\n(3.4)\nIn this equation, ft is the forget gate’s output, Ct−1 is the previous cell state,\nand ⊙denotes element-wise multiplication.\nThis process enables the input gate to selectively update the cell state with\npertinent new information, preserving the LSTM’s capacity for managing long-\nterm dependencies.\n• Update of cell state",

This\nupdate process involves the following key steps:",
    "1. Updating the Cell State: The final update to the cell state Ct combines\nthe previous cell state’s retained information (as decided by the forget gate)\nwith the new information (as decided by the input gate):\nCt = ft ⊙Ct−1 + it ⊙˜Ct\n(3.5)\nThis update mechanism ensures that the LSTM cell state is a dynamic represen-\ntation of the information deemed relevant up to the current time step, enabling\nthe LSTM to effectively manage long-term dependencies in sequential data.\n• Output gate\n20",

Output Decision via Sigmoid Layer: A sigmoid layer evaluates the current\ninput xt and the previous hidden state ht−1 to decide which parts of the cell\nstate Ct are significant for the output.

    "3.2. Autoregressive (AR) Modeling\n21",
    "3.2\nAutoregressive (AR) Modeling\nAutoregressive (AR) models are a fundamental class of models used in time series\nanalysis, particularly effective in scenarios where successive values in the series are\ncorrelated. These models are especially relevant when predicting time-dependent\nphenomena such as EOPs. An AR model predicts future behavior based on past\nbehavior. It assumes that past values have a linear influence on future values. The\nmodel is essentially a regression of the time series onto itself at previous times.\nThe general form of an AR model of order p, denoted as AR(p) is:\nYt = c + ϕ1Yt−1 + ϕ2Yt−2 + . . . + ϕpYt−p + εt\n(3.9)\nHere, Yt is the value of the series at time t, and ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . , ϕp are the coefficients\nthat measure the influence of each lagged value. c is a constant (intercept) term, and\nεt is white noise error. p indicates the number of lagged observations included in the\nmodel.\nDynamics of AR models: In an AR model, each term can be thought of as a\nweighted version of past observations. The weights (ϕ coefficients) determine how\nmuch influence each past observation has on the forecast. The order p of the model\ndefines how far back in the past the model will go to predict the current value. High\nϕ values indicate that the time series is influenced significantly by its past values.\nApplication in EOP forecasting: AR models are particularly useful for EOP forecast-\ning if the data shows that past orientation parameters significantly influence future\nparameters. For instance, if EOP data demonstrates autocorrelation over a specific\nnumber of lags, an AR model of that order could effectively capture this dependence.\nSelecting the order of AR Model: The order p is typically determined through\nanalysis methods like the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF), which helps\nidentify the extent of lagged influence. Overfitting is a risk with higher-order AR\nmodels, so it’s crucial to choose p such that it sufficiently captures the autocorrelation\nwithout being overly complex.\nLimitations: AR models assume linearity and may not perform well with non-linear\ndata. They may not adequately handle time series data with trend and seasonal\ncomponents unless appropriately modified or differenced. AR models can be sensitive\nto outliers, which can significantly influence the coefficient estimates.",
    "3.2.1\nAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Mod-\neling\nARIMA models, standing for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, play an\nimportant role in forecasting EOPs, which are essentially time series data. These\nmodels uniquely blend the elements of autoregression, integration, and moving\naverages to analyze and predict time-dependent data, making them particularly\nsuitable for EOPs.\nARIMA in time series analysis: The concept of stationarity is central to ARIMA’s\napproach, which is crucial for accurate time series forecasting. A time series is\n22",
    "3. Machine Learning Fundamentals\nstationary if its properties like mean and variance do not change over time. ARIMA\nachieves this through integration, with differencing being used to stabilize the mean\nof the time series.\nThe ARIMA(p,d,q) Forecasting Equation: The ARIMA model is defined by its\nparameters: p (the number of autoregressive terms), d (the number of nonseasonal\ndifferences), and q (the number of moving average terms). The forecasting equation\nis a linear function that involves these parameters:\nPredicted Y = constant +\nX\n(weighted sum of recent values of Y )\n+\nX\n(weighted sum of recent forecast errors)\n(3.10)\nVarious configurations of these parameters lead to different ARIMA models. For\nexample:\n• ARIMA(1,0,0): First-Order Autoregressive Model The ARIMA(1,0,0) model,\nclassified as a first-order autoregressive model, is one of the simplest yet effective\nconfigurations in the ARIMA family, particularly useful for time series data like\nEarth Orientation Parameters (EOPs). The model is expressed through the\nequation:\nˆYt = µ + ϕ1Yt−1\n(3.11)\nIn this equation, ˆYt represents the forecasted value of the series at time t, µ is\na constant term, representing the mean level of the series, ϕ1 is the coefficient\nof the first lag of Y , essentially quantifying the influence of the immediate past\nvalue of the series on its current value, and Yt−1 is the observed value at time\nt −1, the direct predecessor of the current period.\nModel Dynamics: The ARIMA(1,0,0) as suggested by (Khaira et al. (2020))\nmodel posits that the current value of the time series can be primarily explained\nby its immediate past value. The coefficient ϕ1 plays a crucial role. If ϕ1 is close\nto 1, it suggests that the series has a strong momentum and the past value has\na significant influence on the current value. If ϕ1 is close to 0, it implies that\nthe past value has little to no effect on the current value, reducing the model\nto essentially ˆYt = µ. The constant µ adjusts the level around which the series\noscillates. If the mean of the series is zero, then µ might not be included in the\nmodel.\nApplicability in EOPs: When applied to EOPs, this model is especially useful if\nthe data shows a pattern where each value tends to be close to its preceding value,\nwith slight variations. For instance, if EOP data demonstrates gradual changes\nrather than abrupt shifts, the ARIMA(1,0,0) model can effectively capture this\nbehavior, assuming that each day’s orientation parameter is a slight modification\nof the previous day’s parameter.\nLimitations: While ARIMA(1,0,0) is powerful in capturing linear relationships\nin time series data, it may not be as effective in scenarios where the data exhibits\nnon-linear patterns, significant seasonal effects, or trends. The model’s simplicity\ncan be a drawback if the EOP data has complex underlying structures that a\nsingle lag and a constant term cannot adequately capture.",
    "3.2. Autoregressive (AR) Modeling\n23\n• ARIMA(0,1,0): The ARIMA(0,1,0) model is described by the equation:\nˆYt = Yt−1 + µ\n(3.12)\nIn this model, ˆYt is the forecasted value at time t. µ represents the mean change\nfrom one observation to the next. It’s the constant term that indicates the\naverage period-to-period change in the series.\nModel Dynamics: This model implies that the best predictor for the next value\nin the series is the most recent observation, with an adjustment by the constant\nmean change. The absence of autoregressive and moving average components\nmeans this model does not account for patterns or trends beyond a simple shift\nby the mean change. A zero value of µ would suggest a pure random walk\nwithout drift, where the best forecast for tomorrow is simply today’s value.\nApplicability to EOPs: ARIMA(0,1,0) is suitable for EOP data that shows\na stable trend over time with minimal fluctuations. If EOPs exhibit a consis-\ntent directional movement (either increasing or decreasing) without significant\nvariations, this model can effectively capture that behavior.\nLimitations: This model may not perform well with EOP data exhibiting\nseasonality, significant fluctuations, or where past values and trends significantly\ninfluence future values.\n• ARIMA(1,1,0): Differenced First-Order Autoregressive Model The ARIMA(1,1,0)\nmodel can be represented as:\nˆYt = µ + Yt−1 + ϕ1(Yt−1 −Yt−2)\n(3.13)\nHere, ϕ1 is the coefficient of the first lag of the differenced series. The term\n(Yt−1 −Yt−2) represents the first difference of the series at time t −1.\nModel dynamics The model combines differencing (to achieve stationarity) with\nautoregression. It predicts the current value based on the previous value and the\nchange that occurred in the last period. This model is particularly useful when\nthe series, once differenced, shows a strong correlation with its lagged values.\nApplicability to EOPs This model is apt for EOP data that shows trends or\npatterns only becoming apparent or stationary after differencing. It’s effective for\nEOPs where each value tends to deviate from the previous value by an amount\nthat is dependent on the recent changes.\nLimitations ARIMA(1,1,0) may not be ideal for EOP data with high seasonality\nor non-linear trends. The model assumes a linear relationship between past\nchanges and future values, which might not always hold in complex time series\ndata like EOPs.",
    "3.2.2\nSeasonal ARIMA(SARIMA) Modeling\nSeasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018)) models are an\nextension of the basic ARIMA models, specifically designed to handle and forecast\ntime series data with seasonal variations. This feature makes SARIMA particularly\nsuitable for data like EOPs, which may exhibit seasonal patterns. SARIMA models\n24",
    "3. Machine Learning Fundamentals\nadd a seasonal component to the standard ARIMA models, addressing both the\ntrend and seasonality in a time series. The model can account for shifts or patterns\nthat repeat over a fixed period.\nSARIMA Model Equation: A SARIMA model is denoted as SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q)s,\nwhere p, d, q are the non-seasonal components (same as in ARIMA). P, D, Q repre-\nsent the seasonal parts of the model. s is the length of the seasonal cycle. The full\nSARIMA model is expressed as:\nY ′\nt = c +\np\nX\ni=1\nϕiY ′\nt−i +\nq\nX\ni=1\nθiεt−i +\nP\nX\ni=1\nΦiY ′\nt−is +\nQ\nX\ni=1\nΘiεt−is + εt\n(3.14)\nHere, Y ′\nt represents the differenced and seasonally differenced series. The ϕ, θ, Φ, and\nΘ terms are coefficients for the autoregressive and moving average components for\nboth non-seasonal and seasonal parts.\nDynamics of SARIMA Models: SARIMA models integrate both non-seasonal and\nseasonal factors in a multiplicative manner. They can handle complex structures in\ntime series data by modeling the dependencies within the observations. The seasonal\nelements P, D, and Q capture the seasonality, allowing the model to account for\npatterns that repeat every s periods. The differencing terms d and D help in making\nthe series stationary, both at the regular and seasonal levels.\nApplication in EOP Forecasting: SARIMA is particularly effective for EOP data if\nit exhibits seasonality – patterns repeating at regular intervals. For instance, if EOPs\nchange in a similar way across the same months or seasons each year, SARIMA can\ncapture this periodicity. The model’s ability to integrate both the long-term trends\nand seasonal fluctuations makes it a comprehensive tool for forecasting EOPs.\nModel selection and challenges: Selecting the appropriate values for p, d, q, P, D, Q,\nand s requires careful analysis, often involving autocorrelation and partial autocor-\nrelation plots, along with seasonal decomposition techniques. Overfitting can be\na concern, particularly with complex models having many parameters. A balance\nmust be struck between adequately capturing the seasonal patterns and maintaining\nmodel parsimony.\nLimitations: The complexity of SARIMA models means they require more parameters\nthan non-seasonal models, which can lead to overfitting if not properly managed.\nThey assume a stable seasonal pattern over time, which might not hold in cases\nwhere the seasonality evolves.",
    "3.3\nRandom Forests (RF) Modeling\nRF is a machine learning algorithm widely used for regression and classification tasks,\nincluding time series forecasting like EOPs. It’s particularly effective in capturing\ncomplex, nonlinear relationships in data. RF models operate by the principle of\nconstructing multiple decision trees during the training phases and output the mode\nof the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.\nThe general prediction equation for RF in a regression context is:\nˆY = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nTi(X)\n(3.15)",
    "3.4. Support Vector Regression(SVR) Modelling\n25\nWhere ˆY is the predicted value, N is the number of trees, Ti(X) is the prediction of\nthe ith tree for input X.\nIn time series forecasting, the input features X are often constructed from lagged\nvalues of the time series. For example, for a time series {Yt}, the feature set for\nprediction at time t could be {Yt−1, Yt−2, . . . , Yt−p}. To transform the time series\ndata into a feature, it can be represented as:\nXt = [Yt−1, Yt−2, . . . , Yt−p]\n(3.16)\nWhere p is the number of lags (past observations) used as predictors.\nTraining and Prediction process: The training process involves constructing each\ndecision tree Ti using a random subset of the data and features. For regression\nproblems, each tree provides a continuous output, and the final prediction is typically\nthe average of all trees’ outputs.\nBenefits and challenges in EOP Forecasting:\n• Handling Non-linearity: RF can model complex patterns in EOP data, which\nmight be nonlinear or have interactions between predictors.\n• Feature importance: RF can evaluate the importance of different lagged values\nin forecasting future EOPs.\n• Robustness: It’s less prone to overfitting, thanks to the averaging process across\nmultiple trees.\nLimitations: RF does not inherently account for seasonality or trend components in\ntime series data. The ensemble nature of RF makes it less interpretable than simpler\nmodels like linear regression. Large numbers of trees and deep trees can make the\nmodel computationally intensive.",
    "3.4\nSupport Vector Regression(SVR) Modelling\nSVR is a powerful machine learning technique derived from Support Vector Machine\n(SVM)s, extensively used for regression tasks, including time series forecasting like\nEOPs. SVR is particularly beneficial for its ability to handle high-dimensional spaces\nand its effectiveness in modeling complex, non-linear relationships.\nCore concept of SVR: SVR is based on the principle of finding a function that\napproximates the relationship between input variables and continuous output with\na margin of tolerance (ε). The objective of SVR is to minimize this margin while\npenalizing data points that fall outside it. The basic form of SVR for a linear\nrelationship is given by:\nf(X) = ⟨w, X⟩+ b\n(3.17)\nWhere f(X) is the predicted value for the input X, w is the weight vector, ⟨·, ·⟩\ndenotes the dot product, and b is the bias term. For non-linear relationships, SVR\nuses kernel functions to map input features into a higher-dimensional space where\n26",

A common choice is the Radial Basis Function\n(RBF) kernel:\nK(Xi, Xj) = exp(−γ∥Xi −Xj∥2)\n(3.18)\nWhere γ is a parameter that determines the spread of the kernel.\nSVR in Time Series Forecasting: In time series forecasting, SVR can be utilized by\ntransforming the series into a supervised learning problem. The input features are\ntypically lagged values of the series. For instance, for EOP forecasting, the input set\nXt for prediction at time t could be [Yt−1, Yt−2, . . . , Yt−p].\nAdvantages of Using SVR in EOP Forecasting Through the use of kernel functions,\nSVR can model complex, non-linear relationships in EOP data. SVR is robust to\noutliers as it focuses on the points near the margin. The use of different kernels\nallows for modeling various data patterns effectively.",

MLP is particularly\nnoted for its ability to capture complex, nonlinear relationships in data.\nAn MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, one or more hidden\nlayers, and an output layer. Each node, except for the input nodes, is a neuron that\nuses a nonlinear activation function.\nMLP Model Structure: The general structure of an MLP for regression tasks can be\nrepresented as:\n• Input Layer: Receives the input features (e.g., lagged values in time series).\n• Hidden Layers: Each layer computes a weighted sum of its inputs, followed by\nan activation function. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified\nLinear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh.\n• Output Layer: Produces the final prediction, typically with a linear activation\nin regression tasks.\nMLP in Time Series Forecasting: For time series forecasting, such as predicting\nEOPs, the MLP model can be structured to take in a series of past observations\nas inputs. If Yt is the time series, the input features for MLP at time t might be\n[Yt−1, Yt−2, ..., Yt−p], where p is the number of lags used.\nTraining and Prediction with MLP: The MLP learns to map the input features to\nthe output (future value of the series) by adjusting the weights and biases in each\nneuron (training).

    "4. Data\ninto a multidimensional representation. This process involves creating lagged vectors\nX1, . . . , XK from X, where each Xi is a vector containing L consecutive elements of\nthe original series. The number of resulting vectors K is determined by the window\nlength L and the length of the original series N such that K = N −L + 1.\nThe window length L is a crucial parameter in embedding. It defines the length of\neach lagged vector and influences the properties of the resulting trajectory matrix.\nThe choice of L is essential; it needs to strike a balance. If L is too small, it might\nnot capture essential characteristics of the time series. Conversely, if L is excessively\nlarge, it could create too many lagged vectors, losing the specific dynamics of the\noriginal series.\nDifferent fields have varying approaches to selecting L. In dynamical systems analysis,\nfor instance, smaller L values are used to calculate correlation dimensions, which\nrelate to the fractal dimensions of the system’s attractor. Here, L is small relative to\na very large K (K →∞). Conversely, methods like Structural Total Least Squares\n(STLS) with Hankel matrix structure often select L = r + 1, where r represents the\nestimated rank of the approximation matrix.\nIn SSA, L should be chosen to be sufficiently large to encapsulate essential dynamics\nof the original series within each lagged vector. Larger L values offer the advantage of\ntreating each lagged vector Xi as an independent series. This enables the exploration\nof specific characteristics and dynamics across this set of derived series.\nThe choice of L is a critical consideration in SSA, impacting how well the resulting\nlagged vectors represent the underlying dynamics of the original time series. It’s\nessential to balance the trade-off between capturing essential information and avoiding\nexcessive fragmentation of the data. Detailed discussions on optimal L selection\ncan be found in specialized literature, allowing practitioners to tailor embedding for\nvarious types of time series analysis.",

The efficiency of the methodology is\nassessed using the MAE measurements.\nEOP prediction for xp and yp: This work describes the utilization of LSTM and\nSARIMA models for predicting the values of xp and yp. A comparative examination\nof these models both with and without the incorporation of SSA improvements.\nEOP prediction for dX and dY : A prediction analysis has been conducted on\nCelestial poles dX and dY also but this chapter does not contain the results as no\nproper requirements were set by ESA for the celestial poles.

    "6.5.1\nComparison with ESA Benchmarks\nWhen evaluating the accuracy of machine learning models for predicting Earth\nOrientation Parameters (EOPs), an important measure for determining success is to\ncompare the model’s performance with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) benchmarks\nestablished by the ESA. This section shows a thorough evaluation of the performance\nof different models, namely Autoregressive (AR), SARIMA, LSTM, and LSTM\nwith Singular Spectrum Analysis (LSTM+SSA), in predicting three essential Earth\nOrientation Parameters (EOPs): xp, yp, and UT1-UTC.\nxp Predictions\nThe AR model for xp predictions had a successful outcome, with a Mean Absolute\nError (MAE) of 0.13 milliarcseconds (mas) on the 1-day forecast. This result is\nsignificantly above the ESA benchmark of 0.3 mas. The SARIMA model significantly\nenhanced the accuracy of the 1-day forecast, obtaining an excellent Mean Absolute\nError (MAE) of 0.07 mas. However, the LSTM model exhibited constraints in\nits ability to accurately predict short-term outcomes, as demonstrated by a mean\nabsolute error (MAE) of 4.44 mas, surpassing the minimum requirement set by the\nESA.\nAs the time frame of the forecast increases, the LSTM model demonstrates a significant\nenhancement in its performance. In the 5-day forecast, the LSTM model had a mean\nabsolute error (MAE) of 2.16 milliarcseconds (mas), which exceeded the standard set\nby the ESA of 1.8 mas. On the other hand, the SARIMA model performed better with\nan MAE of 0.7 mas. After 10 days, the LSTM model performed very well, achieving\nan MAE of 2.02 mas, which closely matched the ESA benchmark. However, when\nthe LSTM model was combined with SSA, the performance significantly deviated,\nresulting in an MAE of 17.70 mas. This indicates that integrating SSA for this\nprediction interval has significant issues. When predicting for extended periods (20,\n40, and 90 days), the LSTM model continuously fulfilled the standards set by the ESA.\nThe Mean Absolute Error (MAE) increased as the prediction interval increased but\nit remained within acceptable boundaries. Significantly, the LSTM model obtained a\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) of 6.6 milliarcseconds (mas) for the 90-day forecast,\nsurpassing the minimum MAE threshold of 23.8 mas. This highlights the LSTM’s\nexceptional ability to predict long-term EOP accurately.\n76",

    "7. Conclusion\nThis thesis focused on the utilization of machine learning methodologies, specifically\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated\nMoving Average (SARIMA) models, for predicting Earth Orientation Parameters\n(EOPs). The results illustrate the efficiency of these models in predicting parameters\nsuch as xpole, ypole, and UT1 −UTC across different time periods.\nFor the short-term (1-day) analysis, SARIMA models demonstrated remarkable\nefficiency, resulting in low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values and proving their\nability to accurately capture the short-term seasonality fluctuations in EOP data.\nFor medium to long-term forecasting, the LSTM model demonstrated high accuracy\nin predicting EOPs over periods spanning from 10 to 90 days. This underlines\nits ability to effectively handle sequential data and the time-related patterns that\nare inherent in EOPs. For short-term forecasts, the SARIMA models accurately\npredicted the values for the next day based on the xpole projections. These models\neffectively dealt with the complexities of both seasonal and non-seasonal trends in\nthe EOP data.\nFor projections ranging from 20 to 90 days, LSTM models consistently demonstrated\nreliable performance, frequently surpassing the accuracy standards set by ESA. The\nutilization of the LSTM model just for UT1-UTC predictions demonstrated improved\nprecision throughout a range of time intervals, encompassing both short-term and\nlong-term forecasts. This emphasizes the model’s flexibility and capacity to adjust\nto various forecasting timeframes.\nDuring the two-week CONT14 campaign, the LSTM model demonstrated exceptional\nprecision by obtaining Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) that were much lower than the\nbenchmarks set by the European Space Agency (ESA) for both the xpole and ypole\nvariables as well as for the UT1-UTC data.\nFinally, this research makes a significant contribution to the field of geodesy and\nEarth sciences. The effective utilization of LSTM and SARIMA models presents new\nopportunities for accurate Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) prediction, which\n82",
    "7. Conclusion\nis crucial for diverse geospatial and astronomical applications. The LSTM model’s\nability to handle both short-term and long-term projections showcases its flexibility,\nmaking it a viable tool for various forecasting scenarios.",
    "7.1\nFuture work\nThe results and methods presented in this thesis provide the foundation for future\nresearch efforts focused on improving the forecasting of Earth Orientation Param-\neters (EOPs). Possible topics for more investigation include Model Optimization,\nInvestigating Alternative Models, and finding extended applications. The LSTM and\nSARIMA models can be enhanced to increase their accuracy, especially in situations\nwhere the forecast performance is not optimal. Subsequent studies could explore\nalternative machine learning methodologies or create hybrid models that may provide\nsuperior precision or computational efficiency in predicting EOP including refining\nthe SSA models for better application. An evaluation of these models in real-time\nprediction scenarios would be highly beneficial to determine their applicability and\ndependability in operational contexts. The effectiveness of these models could be\nevaluated in other fields of Earth sciences, thereby providing wider significance for\nmonitoring the environment, analyzing climate change, and planning space missions.\nA.

The code encompasses data\nnormalization, dataset preparation for the LSTM, model construction, training with\nearly stopping and learning rate scheduling, and finally, making forecasts.\nA.1.4\nPrepare Data for UT1-UTC Prediction and Use of Leap Sec-\nonds\nThe preparation of data for predicting UT1-UTC values involves several critical steps,\nincluding the handling of leap seconds, which are crucial for maintaining accurate\ntimekeeping in astronomical and geodesy applications. The process is outlined below:",
    "1. Data Loading: The UT1-UTC data, along with other relevant measurements,\nare loaded from a CSV file containing historical records. This dataset includes\nmeasurements from January 1, 1972, to November 6, 2023.\n84\nA. Appendix",
    "2. Leap Second Adjustment: Leap seconds are applied to the UT1-UTC data to\naccount for irregularities in Earth’s rotation. A separate DataFrame is created\nto manage these adjustments, with leap seconds being forward-filled to cover all\ndates within the range.",
    "3. Data Merging: The UT1-UTC data and leap second adjustments are merged\nbased on their dates to calculate the corrected UT1-TAI values, which are\nessential for the prediction model.",
    "4. Incorporation of Length of Day (LOD): The LOD measurements are integrated\ninto the dataset, providing a cumulative time correction. This correction is\nthen combined with the UT1-TAI values to obtain the final UT1 values used for\ntraining the predictive model.\nThis preparation process ensures that the data used for training the predictive model\nis accurate and reflects the adjustments necessary for precise timekeeping, including\nthe application of leap seconds and the accumulation of LOD corrections.\nA.1.5\nConverting Predicted UT1 to UT1-UTC and Model Evalua-\ntion\nAfter obtaining the predicted UT1 values, the subsequent step involves adjusting these\npredictions to derive the UT1-UTC values. This adjustment necessitates accounting\nfor time corrections and leap seconds. Subsequently, the model’s accuracy is assessed\nby comparing the adjusted predictions against the actual UT1-UTC values, utilizing\nthe Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the metric.\nAdjusting Predicted UT1 Values\nThe predicted UT1 values are modified to reflect the necessary time corrections and\nthe current leap seconds to facilitate their conversion back to UT1-UTC format. The\nadjustment process entails:\n• Subtracting the cumulative time correction from the predicted UT1 values to\nobtain the UT1-TAI values.\n• Adding the current leap second value to the UT1-TAI values to convert them\ninto UT1-UTC values.\nModel Evaluation\nThe model’s predictive performance is evaluated by comparing the adjusted predicted\nUT1-UTC values with the original UT1-UTC values, using the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) as the evaluation metric. This comparison offers a quantitative assessment of\nthe model’s accuracy.\nThe MAE metric provides insight into the average magnitude of the errors in the\npredictions, where lower values indicate a higher accuracy of the model. Evaluating\nthe model using this metric is essential for understanding its effectiveness and\npinpointing potential areas for enhancement.\nA.2.

In the next few years, the suborbital space-crafts \nwill transport payloads and passengers to space. People who may be flying into suborbital space will have a world \nclass adventure that will bring a lifetime’s memory. People will experience the weightlessness of few minutes but \nwill expose to solar radiation and bombarded with cosmic rays by supernovae and other galactic explosion. Cosmic \nRays are inescapable in space, ripping right through an astronaut damaging the DNA and causing cancer. Galactic \ncosmic rays are one of the most important barriers standing in the way of plans for sub-orbital flights by crewed \nspacecraft. Cosmic rays also pose a threat to electronics with the next level microelectronics which are extremely \nsensitive placed aboard outgoing probes. While the space is full of radiation, the earth’s magnetic fields protect the \nplanet and people in low earth orbit from the particles. But once the astronaut are expose to high amount of radiation \nwith the constant shower of various radioactive particles. This radiation exists in low levels, the longer an astronaut \nis in deep space, the greater the exposure. We can’t precisely trace the cosmic rays as it is bent by magnetic fields \nand it is impossible to control the level of radiations, astronauts are exposed to. \n \nKeywords: Cosmic Rays, Supernovae, Magnetic Field, Solar Radiation",
    "1. Introduction  \nSuborbital spaceflights offers opportunity to ‘touch’ \nspace and experience ‘weightlessness’ by creating \nsubstantial public interest. But due to the fact that \nradiation exists throughout the universe, originating \nfrom many sources with varying intensities and \ncomposition. For a number of radiation effects in the \nelectronics and sensor systems of spacecraft due to \nforbush decreases of intense cosmic ray [1] fluxes. The \nnatural space radiation environment can be classified \ninto two populations: all the particles including protons, \nelectrons and heavier ions and transient particles which \nare trapped by planetary magnetosphere in ‘belts’, \nwhich include protons and heavy ions of all elements of \nthe periodic table. The Earth’s magnetosphere is \nswamped  by a nearly isotropic flux of cosmic rays.",

    "1.2 Suborbital \n      Sub-orbital space tourism is yet to start, although \norbital space tourism has already taken place ,that is due \nto a quick of history, and it is far easier to provide sub-\norbital space tourism than the orbital space tourism \nexperience. \nThere are likely to be a range of new ideas and \npossibilities for doing this. Two operations are \ndescribed briefly below. The Virgin Galactic sub-orbital \nspace tourism operation has taken place using the \nSpaceShipTwo \nspacecraft \nreleased \nfrom \nthe \nWhiteKnightTwo mother plane (Fig. 3). Burt Rutan has \nbuilt both the spacecraft and mother plane in order to \nwin the Ansari X-Prize in 2004. The SpaceShipTwo \nspacecraft can carry six passengers into space, and \ninitial prices are set at $200,000 per flight. The program \nis well advanced, and SpaceShipTwo has been \nundergoing the first flights in its flight test regime.. \nXCOR team has offered a very different architecture for \nsub-orbital space tourism, when they provide flights in \ntheir Lynx rocket plane(Fig. 1). The Lynx will not use a \nmother plane, but will use its rocket engines for the \nentire flight. It can carry only one passenger at one time, \nwhich will sitting next to the pilot. Initial Prices will be  \n$100,000 but the first version of Lynx will not reach the \nfull 100 km altitude line; but later versions will. \nDifferent architectures has been proposed for sub-orbital \nspace tourism by other potential providers, some would \nuse a amalgamation of jet engines and rocket motors, \nand  some of which will be wingless and complete the \nwhole flight profile in vertical motion. \n \n \n \n \n \n                       Figure 1: XCOR lynx \n \n \n \n              Figure 2: Flight profile of XCOR lynx \n \n \n \n           Figure 3: SpaceShipTwo spacecraft under     \n                            WhiteKnighttwo \n    \n \n \n \n \n67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Guadalajara, Mexico, 26-30 September 2016.  \nCopyright ©2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

    "2. Material and Methods  \n    As we all know that when solar flares [2][3] explode \nfrom sun’s atmosphere, along with the gigantic burst of \nlight in nearly all wavelengths, waves of energetic \nparticles are accelerated by this event. Mostly protons, \nwith a few electrons and heavier elements mixed in, this \nwould have been dangerous to humans who are outside \nearth’s protective magnetic shield. In the early days of \nhuman space flight, scientists were only just beginning \nto understand how solar radiation [4] could affect space, \nand in turn how that radiation could affect humans and \ntechnology. Radiation, at its most basic, is simply waves \nor sub atomic particles that transport energy to another \nentity- whether it is an astronaut or component of \nspacecraft. Particle radiation in space is the main \nconcern. Energetic particles are often dangerous to \nhumans as a result of they pass all over the skin, \ndepositing energy and damaging cells or DNA on the \nmanner. This harm will mean associate exaggerated risk \nfor cancer later in life or, at its worst, acute radiation \nthroughout the mission if the dose of energetic particles \nis massive enough. Throughout the entire trip, \nastronauts must be protected from two sources of \nradiation. The first comes from the sun, that frequently \nreleases a gradual stream of solar particles, also as \noccasional huge bursts within the wake of big \nexplosions, like solar flares and coronal mass ejections, \non the sun.. These energetic particles area unit the \nmajority protons, and, although the sun releases AN \nunfathomably sizable amount of them, the nucleon \nenergy is low enough that they'll the majority be \nphysically secure by the structure of the space vehicle. \nThe second supply of energetic particles is harder to \nshield. These particles comes from galactic cosmic rays, \ntypically called GCRs. These are particles accelerated to \nnear the speed of light that shoot into our solar system \nfrom other stars in the Milky Way or even other \ngalaxies. Like solar particles, galactic cosmic rays are \nmostly protons. However, some of them are heavier \nelements, ranging from helium up to the heaviest \nelements. These more energetic particles can knock \napart atoms in the materials they strike, such as in the \nastronaut, the metal walls of a spacecraft , habitat, or \nvehicle, causing sub atomic particles to shower into the \nstructure. This secondary radiation, as it is known, can \nreach a dangerous level. There are two ways to shield \nfrom these higher energy particles and their secondary \nradiation: use a lot more mass of traditional space craft \nmaterials, or use more efficient shielding materials. The \nsheer volume of materials surrounding a structure would \nabsorb the energetic particles and their associated \nsecondary particle radiation before they could reach the \nastronauts. However, using sheer bulk to protect \nastronauts would be prohibitively expensive, since more \nmass means more fuel required to launch. The best way \nto stop particle radiation is by running that energetic \nparticle into something that’s a similar size, because \nprotons and neutrons are similar in size, one element \nblocks both extremely well hydrogen, which most \ncommonly exists as just a single proton and an electron. \nConveniently, hydrogen, which is the most abundant \nelement in the universe, and make up substantial parts \nof some common compounds, such as water and plastics \nlike polyethylene.  Engineers could take advantage of \nalready required mass by processing the astronaut’s \ntrash into plastic-filled tiles used to bolster radiation \nprotection. Water, already required for the crew, could \nbe stored strategically to create a kind of radiation storm \nshelter in the spacecraft or habitat. However, this \nstrategy comes with some challenges- the crew would \nneed to use the water and then replace it with recycled \nwater from the advanced life support systems. \nPolyethylene [5], the same plastic commonly found in \nwater bottles and grocery bags, also has potential as a \ncandidate for radiation shielding. It is very high in \nhydrogen and fairly cheap to produce- however, it’s not \nstrong enough to build a large structure, especially a \nspacecraft, which goes through high heat and strong \nforces during launch. And adding polyethylene to a \nmental structure would add quite a bit of mass, meaning \nthat more fuel would be required for launch.",
    "3. Theory  \nSubatomic particles [6] coming from solar radiation \nand cosmic rays are constantly arriving from distant \nstars and galaxies and passing right through us. They \ncan cause significant problems and dangers for humans. \nThey can also harm our computer run programs as all \ncomputers run programs using a code of zeroes and \nones. When a cosmic ray hits a computer chip, it can \ncause a reaction with the silicon, sending the wires over \ntheir critical voltage. This can flip one of the bits in the \ncode from zero to one or one to zero, and suddenly the \ncode is incorrect. The program now has a “soft error” \nthat may cause it to fail.(Fig.4) Soft errors are an on-\ngoing problem for computer engineers, which are more \neffected by cosmic rays. Computers in a spacecraft are \nresponsible for navigation and life support, so it is \nessential for accuracy and precision to be maintained \nand for errors not to occur. As like humans require \nprotection from cosmic rays to avoid the harmful \ndisease-causing effects of radiation computers too \nrequire protection, for those computers currently have \nsome software in to search for and fix errors. For this \nwe have some radiation shielding materials including \naluminium, steel, gold and magnets. We can use these \nmaterials for their cosmic ray shielding ability.  \nAlpha particles can be easily stopped by things like \nskin or paper. Beta particles can pass through water; \nhowever, thin aluminium is easily capable of stopping \nit. Lead or concrete are needed to stop X-rays, gamma \nrays, and radio waves. Neutrons can only stopped by \n67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Guadalajara, Mexico, 26-30 September 2016.  \nCopyright ©2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

They can be affected by magnetic \nfields. The magnetic field of the earth acts as a shield \nagainst some cosmic rays. \n \n             Figure 4: Diagram of soft error",
    "4. Mitigation \n     In order to avoid the anomalies of energetic solar \nparticles and cosmic rays, feasible mitigations have to \nbe looked upon.  \n \nThe compartment of the crew can be placed in \nthe aft of the spacecraft in order to create \nnatural shielding without using excessively \nmassive elements such as lead in the \ntranquillity of the spacecraft partitions so that \nall the rays including solar radiation and \ncosmic rays does not affect the crew spacecraft \nwhere all the passengers are present[5]. \n \nSome shielding materials such as aluminium \nfoil, gold leaf, steel or magnet shields can also \nbe used in order to detect the fewer cosmic \nrays.  \n \n \n \n                Figure 5: Nuclear Propulsion System with \n                                Shadow Shielded Core",
    "5. Result \n      By summing up all the possible space experiences, \nwe realise that there will be competitive offerings, \nopening up a genuine market place which will ensure \nthat service will improve, safety and reliability will \nincrease, and prices will come down, exactly as has \nhappened with aviation.",
    "6. Discussion  \n     The research indicates that beta particles can be \nstopped by a few millimetres of aluminium. The steel \nplate sample is thicker and denser than the aluminium, \nso its likely to block out more cosmic rays than \naluminium. But out of these gold foils have significant \neffect on the cosmic rays as they are thinner and denser. \nAs we know cosmic rays can be influenced by the \nmagnetic fields of the Earth and sun, it may also be \npossible to slightly alter its path using small metal \nmagnets.",
    "7. Conclusions  \nBasic research provides the required definitions for \nthe understanding of radiation effects and for the \ndevelopment of models useful for designing radiation \nhardened systems. Due to the increasing sensitivity of \nmicroelectronics to radiation and the increasing \ncomplexity of spacecraft systems, it is more difficult to \ncompletely avoid the risk of radiation effects on a \nsystem. The goal is to reduce such risk, and the only \nway to do so is by monitoring every parameter of the \nradiation environment. It would be helpful to know \nwhat energies and types of cosmic rays were being \ndetected because it would give insight into why the \nshield did not block significant amounts of radiation. \nThe shields may need some variations in order to block \nharmful radiations coming from sun and cosmic rays.",
    "8. Future Aspect \n       In the future, thicker samples of steel, aluminium, \nand gold will be used. Stronger magnets will be tested \nto determine if magnetism is an effective deflection \nmethod in larger amounts. More investigation could also \nbe performed on other materials such as polyethylene \nbecause its high hydrogen content suggests it would be \nan effective shield.    \n \n Acknowledgement \nI wish to express my deep gratitude to our guide Dr. \nUger Guven, for all advice, encouragement and constant \nsupport he has us throughout my paper. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Guadalajara, Mexico, 26-30 September 2016.  \nCopyright ©2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Presently Interorbital Systems \nare the only manufactures of Commercial TubeSats, but \nUniversities all over the world have dabbled in the \nsmaller version of the TubeSat which is the CanSat.  \nNow the reason a TubeSat is going to be used is mainly \nbecause structural costs are reduced in a TubeSat by \nhaving the PCB boards serve as the structural elements \nseparated by Teflon spacers. In this way the TubeSat is \nalso lighter when compared to the CubeSat. The \ndisadvantage to a TubeSat is therefore its structural \nintegrity when compared to a CubeSat. Economically \nTubeSats are cheaper and cost around 1250 USD \nwhereas in the case of a CubeSat sometimes the Shell \nitself costs the same as that of the whole TubeSat.[1] \n \n \nFig 2.Models of a TubeSat (Left) and a CubeSat (Right) \n \nNow as the study is being conducted by university \nstudents with limited resources, the functionalities that \ncan be performed by the TubeSat is limited compared to \nactual SETI satellites in space.

    "3.2 Selection of Orbit \nAs the title states, the selected orbit to place the \nsatellite will be the Low Earth Orbit (LEO).Some of the \nreasons that LEO has been chosen are as follows:",
    "1. The distance between the user and the satellite is \ncomparatively less and therefore there is less path loss.",
    "2. Less Energy is expended to place the satellite in LEO \nand thus the overall cost of the project is economical.",

    "4. Results and Discussion  \nA cheaper and feasible way of sending satellites to \nspace for space science is quite significant itself. With \nuniversities now able to send their own satellites, \n67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Guadalajara, Mexico, 26-30 September 2016.  \nCopyright ©2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \nIAC-16-A4-2-9-x35120  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 4 of 5 \nstudents will be able to experience first-hand the work \nof an astronomer or an astrophysicist. With Universities \nsending their satellites into space the number of “eyes” \nthat are searching increases, thus increasing the chances \nof a sighting. \n \nFor LEO communications, there are certain \nbandwidths that can be used and it is mostly along these \nbandwidths that the students of the universities will be \nallowed to manipulate their communication channels. \nAmateur satellites generally use signals in the frequency \nrange of 29300 – 29500 kHz. Commercial or \ngovernment satellites use the spectrum in the range of \n146 – 138 kHz. The reason that amateurs don’t go for \nlower frequency ranges is because the lower the \nfrequency, the larger the antenna required, usually in a \nyagi configuration. Also lower the frequency, the lower \nis the bandwidth and therefore slower transfer rates. \nMost communication satellites today operate on the Ku \nBand. \n \nIt should be kept in mind however that SETI is a \nhard journey to complete as we do not know exactly \nwhat to look for. Let us take the example of receiving a \nradio signal, for a radio circuit to be established, it is \nnecessary to generate then transmit a signal through \nspace which should then be received by a highly \nsensitive antenna on earth or a satellite amidst all the \nnoise that exists in space along with the noise produced \nby the antenna itself. The sensitivity of such an antenna \nmust be very high and there are limits placed on how \nsensitive an antenna can be by the laws of physics. Also \npresently we as a civilization have moved on from \nanalog signals to digital signals and what is to say that \nthe transmitting civilization is also in the same phase. \nThe problem that arises with digital signals is that \nwithout knowing the characteristics of the transmitted \nsignal, a suitable receiver cannot be made. Other factors \nthat have to be taken into consideration would the \nsource planets revolution about its own axis, its \ninclination about its axis, its orbital period about its \nlocal star(s) (if any) and so on. [4] \n \n But these numbers of probabilities do not deter \nresearchers in SETI. After the discovery the microwave \nregion, physicists have determined it to be the most \nsuitable \nregion \nfor \nspace \nor \ninterplanetary \ncommunication. SETI began sometime in the 1960s and \nby 1984 the SETI Inst. Was established in California to \norganize scientific research and educational programs \non life in the universe. The Inst. With NASA began the \nProject Phoenix, which observed for a total of 100 days \nover a 5 and a half year period at the 305 metre dish in \nPuerto Rico. The Search system covered a total of 58 \nmillion radio channels. \n \nIn 1997, SETI established the Allen telescope array, \na series of LNSD optimized to cover frequencies \nbetween 500 to 10,000 MHz initially but can now cover \nbetween the ranges of 1000 to 15,000 MHz. One the \nadvantages that come with the use of an array is that it \nremoves the limitation of only focusing on one star. The \narray creates a set of pixels over the sky and can thus \nmonitor multiple stars at a time. The Allen telescope \narray also features an antenna placement known as \noffset Georgian system, because placing them on the \nside can reduce interference. Another advantage of the \nAllen Telescope Array is that the array can be made \nbigger if required thus increasing the area of search. \n \nAnother interesting project in space science is the \nCAMS project sponsored by NASA that was built for \nobservation of meteors. The goal of the project is to \nverify meteor showers in search of their parent comets \nand newly discovered near earth objects.  \n \nIn future with one could try to co-relate the data \nobtained from the Allen Telescope Array and the \nCAMS. By providing Universities with the ability and \nthe tools required to research space science, aspiring \nresearchers gain more experience in the field and can \nthus procure more valuable data.    \nConclusions  \nIt can be concluded that the LEO orbit is the best \norbit for an economical space science project. The \nsatellite design that proves to be most feasible as well as \neconomical is the TubeSat over the CubeSat thus \nproviding Universities around the globe a gateway into \nspace science. \n \nAcknowledgements  \nWe would like to thank the University of Petroleum \nand Energy Studies and our mentor Dr. Ugur Guven for \nproviding the resources needed for the research to be \nconducted.  \n \nReferences \n[1]CubeSats and TubeSats,  \n \nhttps://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/diy\n-satellite-platforms/9781449312756/ch03s02.html, \n(accessed 20.06.16). \n \n [2] \nIOS, \nTubeSat \nPersonal \nSatellite \nKit,  \nhttp://www.interorbital.com/interorbital_06222015_",

Microwaves: The data received using the \nmicrowaves will help us to determine the \nmetals on the surface. This could let us \ndetermine if there are any metallic structures \non the surface. This is only possible if there are \nany intelligent beings present on that planet.  \nb. Infra-Red: Check for the heat signatures \nreceived. Eliminate the galactic background \nheat signatures. Check for the anomalies which \nmay be present on the planet.

The \nspecific impulse of a spacecraft depends directly on \nthe energy density (J) of the flow that is being \nutilized.[6] \nIsp = √(2J) = Ve/g \nWhere, J= Specific Potential \n \nA specific impulse below 10,000 would not even \nbe discussable as an interstellar travel would take a \nvery long time, which could not be manageable by \nany standards concerning life support as well as the \nlogistics of the spacecraft.",

First discovered 86 years ago, the celestial body was christened Pluto and was coined as the ninth planet of \nsolar system. Since then various other celestial bodies of similar masses and sizes were discovered and were \ncollectively named the Kuiper Belt. Since the discovery of Eris the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally \ndeﬁned the term planet thus moving Pluto to the dwarf planet category. Since its discovery scientists and astronomers \nalike have been curious towards the nature of this celestial body. The recent launch of the New Horizons spacecraft \nby NASA in 2006 took about nine years to ﬂy by Pluto. During its brief ﬂyby of Pluto it made detailed measurements \nof Pluto and its moons. Man ﬁrst set foot on the moon in the year 1969 and now preparations are under way for a \nmanned mission to Mars. A manned mission to Pluto would signify the freeing of humanity from its shackles, \ntethering us to our Solar System. This paper will focus on the possibility of a manned mission to Pluto, the method of \nachieving this and the resources required. A detailed case study is prepared on the topic describing past and present \nproposed methods, their drawbacks, resources and technology required. The paper will also look into the future of \nthis endeavour with the advancement in technology. A glance will also be thrown towards the moons of Pluto and the \nother bodies present in Kuiper belt describing their orbits, geology, atmosphere and surface compositions. The \npossibility of this mission will open new horizons extending our grasp on the understanding and workings of our \nuniverse and in local sense our solar system. \n \nKeywords: Pluto, Kuiper Belt, Unmanned, Orbit, \n                   Technology",
    "1. Introduction \nRobotic missions are much cheaper and may provide \nmore scientific information, but they don't catch the \npublic imagination in the same way, and they don't \nspread the human race into space, which I'm arguing \nshould be our long-term strategy. “If the human race is \nto continue for another million years, we will have to \nboldly go where no one has gone before.\" ~ Stephen \nHawking \nPluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 losing \nits status as a planet. This move caused much \ncontroversy and debate. Contradictory believes of \nconsidering Pluto a full-fledged planet or not is an \ninteresting discussion that made one thing certain: The \nobject is shrouded in mystery, and we don't have a \ncomplete picture of what it would be like to live there. \nWe've never been to anywhere like Pluto.  \nUnmanned exploratory missions can collect data but \nthey cannot detect weird microscopic life-forms that are \nnot in our database yet. At least not yet. They are not \nprogrammed to recognize what might be lurking below \nthe surface of Charon, or beneath the icy murky seas of \nPluto. Astronaut missions are expensive and riskier than \n67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Guadalajara, Mexico, 26-30 September 2016.  \nCopyright ©2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

    "2. Pluto  \nPluto is the largest known dwarf planet in the solar \nsystem and was once considered the ninth and most \ndistant planet from the sun. Beyond the gas giant \nNeptune lies an entire region of space filled with icy \nbodies known as the Kuiper Belt, of which Pluto is the \nlargest \nknown \nmember \nof. \nIn \n2006, \nPluto \nwas reclassified as a dwarf planet, a change widely \nconsidered as a demotion. This question of Pluto's \ncelestial status attracted a lot of controversies and stirred \na debate in the scientific community, and among the \ngeneral public as well.  \nLaunched on January 19, 2006, NASA's New Horizons \nspacecraft flashed past Pluto on July 14, 2015. From \nPluto’s unusual heart-shaped region to its extended \natmosphere and intriguing moons, New Horizons has \nrevealed a degree of diversity and complexity in the \nPluto system that few expected in the frigid outer \nreaches of the solar system.",
    "3.  Composition & Structure",
    "3.1 Atmospheric Composition - Nitrogen, methane. \nObservations by New Horizons reveals that \natmosphere of Pluto extends as far as sixteen \nhundred kilometers (1,000 miles) above the \nsurface of the dwarf planet.",
    "3.2 Magnetic Field - Although unknown about the \nexistence of Pluto’s magnetic field, the slow \nrotation and small size of the dwarf planet \nsuggest it has little to no such field.",
    "3.3 Chemical Composition - Estimating a mixture \nof 30 percent water ice and 70 percent rock is \nquite probable.",
    "3.4 Internal Structure - Pluto probably has a rocky \ncore enclosed within a mantle of water ice \nalong with more exotic ices such as carbon \nmonoxide, methane and nitrogen ice coating \nthe entire surface.",
    "4. Orbit and Rotation \nPluto's rotation is retrograde compared to the other \nworlds of our solar systems. It spins from east to \nwest.",
    "4.1 Average distance from the sun - 5,906,380,000 \nkilometers (3,670,050,000 miles) which is",
    "39.482 times the distance of Earth.",
    "4.2 Perihelion (closest distance from the sun) - \n4,436,820,000 kilometers (2,756,902,000miles) \nwhich is 30.171 times the distance of Earth",
    "4.3 Aphelion (farthest approach to the sun) - \n7,375,930,000 kilometers (4,583,190,000miles) \nwhich is 48.481 times the distance of Earth \n \nMaking \nthis \nmission \nsuccessful, \nNASA's \nmost \nimpressive achievements till date coined a question – \nWhat Next?",
    "5. Sending Man to Pluto \nThe next logical step for further expansion of our \ntechnically bounded horizons would be of a robotic \nPluto lander followed by manned mission to Pluto. New \nHorizons is currently the fastest spacecraft that has ever \nleft Earth. It crossed Jupiter’s orbit the very next year of \nits launch and had travelled nearly a million miles in a \nday. Still it took about 9.5 years for the spacecraft to \nreach Pluto and its moons. Organizing a manned \nmission will require additional 10 years for their return \nback. Food, air, water, fuel, exercise and life in zero \ngravity for 20 years would make any team going \nincapable of living back on the Earth for a longer period \nof time after their return from the mission. In order to \novercome that, time duration of the mission needs to be \ncompensated. \nThe most advanced propulsion systems in our \ntechnological grasp today requires 10 to 15 years for \ndelivering 1.6-kilogram (3.5 lbs.) spacecraft in Pluto’s \norbit. The International Space Station (ISS) has been \ncontinuously orbiting around the Earth, manned, since \nOct. 31, 2000. There is, of course, a wide difference \nbetween the ISS and a manned Pluto spacecraft \nincluding the lack of significant propulsion. The ISS has \nbeen resupplied and occupied by crews rotating from \nEarth several times per annum for the past 14 years. \nWhereas, astronauts traveling to Pluto would be utterly \nisolated with self-contained life supporting systems. The \nlongest period of a human spending time in space has \nbeen recorded of 437 days and no self-contained, closed \nbiosphere has the capacity of holding human life for \nmore than two years.  \nThe only known spacecraft propulsion technology \nthat is capable of delivering a multihundred-ton manned \nspacecraft to Pluto within a year has been laying around \nsince 1950s and is titled Project Orion. The concept of \nthis technology is to propel the spacecraft by exploding \nthousands of small nuclear bombs fixated behind it. \nEach detonation drives a \"pusher plate\" of the spacecraft \nby an enormous set of shock absorbers. The exhaust \nvelocities created are 10s-100s of kilometres per second \nwith millions of tons of thrust. The project essentially \nworked out in 1960s was revisited by NASA in 2000 \n67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Guadalajara, Mexico, 26-30 September 2016.  \nCopyright ©2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \nIAC-16-A5,IP,10,x35345                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 3 of 6 \nunder the name of External Pulsed Plasma Propulsion. \nThe Physicist from 1960s developed an advanced \ninterplanetary configuration which was capable of \ndelivering a 10,000-ton spacecraft to Saturn and return \nback in three years. Such a spacecraft could not be \nlaunched directly from the Earth's surface due to its \nnuclear fallout. Instead, it could be constructed in the \norbit of Earth, with the help of ISS and depart for Pluto \nfrom there. In a couple of years, the nuclear powered \nspacecraft would decelerate into orbit around Pluto \nwhile turning off its engines. Human carrying ship \ndescending to Pluto's surface would use more \nconventional chemical rockets. Gravitational force on \nPluto’s Surface is about 1/12 of Earth's (half of the \nmoon’s as well). Landing on the surface from a low \norbit at an altitude of 100 kilometres (62 miles) will \nrequire half the Delta-V of a landing on the moon from \nthe same height (i.e. Eight hundred meters per second \nversus seventeen hundred meter per second).",
    "6. Touching Down on Pluto  \n Landing on Pluto would present some unique \nchallenges especially if the spacecraft is manned. \nPluto’s surface has a thin atmosphere of methane, \nnitrogen and carbon monoxide. The surface pressure of \nPluto varies from 6.5 to 24 microbars about as thick as \nEarth's atmosphere 80 kilometres (50 miles) up. This is \nnot enough to provide any useful aero-braking \ncapability (like a parachute) but enough to require some \nkind of heat shield. \nAn equipment to be considered for that to overcome is \nSpaceX's Dragon V2 capsule. It is probably a step in the \nright direction as it combines heat shield with \npropulsive landing rockets. The Dragon V2 can store \nenough fuel for 300 meter per second Delta-V, so extra \nfuel tanks are needed in order to take off, land and \nrendezvous with the orbiting mother ship. The \ntechnology available seems feasible for the project. \nThere might be other hazards to be considered. Surface \nof the Moon is made mostly of silicate rock. Whereas, \nPluto is covered with ice. Not just water ice, but frozen \nnitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. On contact \nwith extremely hot rocket exhaust at thousands of \ndegrees, there's a real danger of the vaporization of the \nlanding site. Some previous equipment’s are needed to \nbe transported in order to create a stable landing surface \nfor the first Pluto explorers.",
    "7. Future Scope of this Endeavor  \nThe time duration for the entire journey can be  \nexhausting. And knowing no bounds to human minds, \nthe atmosphere inside the spacecraft can get homicidal. \nPsychological and biological factors are vital concern. \nThe crew can be induced to hibernation, an alternative \nto the problems of survival making them easier to \nresolve. Hibernation is a kind of torpor, or reduced \nmetabolism which can be induced by hypothermia. \nUnlike in cryogenics, the body will not actually freeze. \nA 10 degree drop in the temperature of body can \nreduces metabolic rate by 50 to 70 percent. Dormant \nastronauts would be immobilized in their special \nhibernation capsules. They will not require pressurized \nliving space or artificially generated gravity. In their \ncoma induced state, astronauts would be regularly \nmonitored automatically by the spacecraft’s computer, \nand fed intravenously. \n \n \n \nFig 1- Scientists are hoping to induce an unconscious \nstate in astronauts so that they can be stored in cold \ncapsules for long space flights. \n \nRadiation is a major concern in deep-space travel. \nHeavy shielding against radiation could be provided \nonly to the crew’s sleep capsules and the large living \nareas of the ship are saved from this technological \nimplement, saving a lot of weight and fuel.",
    "8. Kuiper Belt  \nBeyond the gas giant Neptune lies the third zone of \nsolar system, a region of space filled with icy bodies. \nThis region is known as the Kuiper Belt, this chilly \nexpanse in space holds trillions of mysterious objects \nthat are remnants of the early solar system. \nThe Kuiper Belt is an elliptical plane in the later solar \nsystem spanning from thirty to fifty times Earth's \ndistance from the sun, or 4.5 to 7.4 billion kilometres \n(2.5 to 4.5 billion miles). The belt appears similar to the \nasteroid belt found between Mars and Jupiter, although \nobjects in the Kuiper Belt tend more towards icy in \nnature rather than rocky. \n67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Guadalajara, Mexico, 26-30 September 2016.  \nCopyright ©2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

The existence of the belt could not be realized \nuntil scientists discovered a slowly moving, small world \nin the outer region of our solar system in 1992 (Jane \nLuu and David Jewitt found the KBO, 1992QB1.). \nOther discoveries soon followed, and astronomers \nquickly realized that the region beyond Neptune was \nfilled with icy rocks and tiny worlds. \nSedna, about three-fourth of the size of Pluto, was \ndiscovered in 2004. It is so far away from the sun that it \ntakes about 10,500 years to make one single orbit. \nSedna is about 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) wide and \nrevolves around the sun on an eccentric orbit that ranges \nbetween 12.9 billion kilometers (8 billion miles) and \n135 billion kilometers (84 billion miles). \nOn July 2005, astronomers announced the discovery of \na large object in the Kuiper Belt thought to be even \nlarger than Pluto, though subsequent observations \ndenied the previous observations and it was found \nslightly smaller. Dubbed as Eris, it orbits the sun \napproximately once in every 580 years, traveling almost \na hundred times farther from the sun than Earth. Eris’s \ndiscovery disputed the problem of terming Pluto a full-\nscale planet between the astronomers, and in 2006, Eris, \nPluto, and the largest asteroid Ceres were classified as \ndwarf planets. Two more dwarf planets were discovered \nin \nthe \nKuiper \nBelt \nin \n2008 \nknown \nas \nHaumea and Makemake.",
    "9. Moons of Pluto  \nPluto has five moons orbiting around: Charon, Nix, Styx, \nKerberos and Hydra, where Charon being the closest \nand Hydra being the most distant to Pluto.",
    "9.1 Charon - In 1978, astronomers discovered a \nvery large moon nearly half the size of Pluto. \nThis moon was called Charon. \nBeing so similar in size unlike most of the other planets \nand their moons, Charon and Pluto formed a unique \nsystem. Both Pluto and Charon orbit a common point in \nspace that lies in-between them, just like the orbits of \nbinary star systems, for this reason, Pluto and Charon \nare referred as double planet, a double dwarf planet or a \nbinary system.

With the spread of technical knowledge of launching a satellite around the world, even more \nnations are getting involved in the space launch sector and with the increasing launches, the enormous problem of \nspace debris has come up. Space debris has substantially increased the threats to the launch activities and all the \norbiting satellites are now in danger of an unexpected collision at any point of time. There are currently more than \nthousand active satellites orbiting the earth and along with them there are millions of space debris fragments going at \nspeeds of several kilometres per seconds. Space debris is a threat to any spacecraft irrespective of the orbit. Though \nthe quantity of space debris differs in different orbits, with the most concentration in the Low Earth Orbit and least in \nthe High Earth Orbit. Low Earth Orbit have reached to the critical density of unwanted fragments and parts. \nSatellites now face many problems that range from damages to even destabilization of their orbit. These problems \nmust be resolved in next few years or it will become very difficult to launch satellites in the low earth orbit in the \ncoming years. The accumulation of the space debris presents a real threat to productive use of space. This paper \nseeks to explore the history of space debris and also list the problems that are now faced by any new satellites that \nare deployed in the low earth orbit. The orbital calculations for any new satellite that is launched today have become \nvery complex and sometimes trajectory corrections have to be done in orbit to avoid a certain piece of junk. This \npaper explores all these challenges and explains some of the consequences if proper measures are not undertaken to \ncurb space debris. As case study, a typical university Nano satellite at 700km of altitude will be analyses in terms of \nspace debris mitigation. \n \nKeywords: Space Debris, Low Earth Orbit, Mitigation",
    "1. Introduction \nThe surprise launch of world’s first artificial \nsatellite, Russia's Sputnik, in 1957 ignited an explosion \nof interest in the various possibilities of satellite \ntechnology. Apart from the implications of military of \nits development as a weapons platform it also awakened \nengineers to the potential of using this technology for \npeaceful applications including the potential of Arthur \nC. Clarke's dream of a worldwide communications on \nthe grounds of Geostationary Satellites that might at last \nbe realised. But first some serious technical issues had \nto be considered. \nThe environment of LEO is becoming congested \nwith space debris because of the frequency of object \nlaunches. This has caused rapid growth of concern in \nrecent years, since collisions at orbital velocities are \nvery dangerous, and even fatal. Collisions can result in \neven more space debris during the process, creating a \ndomino effect, which is known as Kessler Syndrome. \nThe possibilities of a collision happening with space \ndebris is becoming a real problem for artificial satellites. \n67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Guadalajara, Mexico, 26-30 September 2016.  \nCopyright ©2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

    "2. Origin of Space Debris \nSpace Debris is the collection of defunct man-made \nobjects in space. The sources of space debris are rocket \nstages, and fragments of from disintegration, and \ncollision. Since year 2009, the United States Strategic \nCommand was tracking around 19,000 pieces of \ncluttered debris larger than 5 cm (2 inches), with a \nfurther estimation of about over 600,000 pieces smaller \nthan 1 cm (0.4 inches) of which about 300,000 pieces \nwere already circulating below an altitude of 200 km \n(125 miles). These pieces might be small but this space \njunk is usually travelling at a relative speeds of 50,000 \nkmph or even more with huge kinetic energy capable of \ncreating catastrophic damage. Although, the outer space \nis often considered to be an empty, desolated place, the \nregion surrounding the Earth swarms with thousands \nand millions of pieces, of debris created by our kind that \ncan lead to potential hazards for their artificially \nfunctioning neighbours. \n \nFig 1- Earth during year 2010 (Source:NASA)",
    "3. Types of Orbits",
    "2.1 Low Earth Orbit - A low Earth orbit (LEO) is \nan orbit around Earth with an altitude between \n160 km with an orbital period of about 88 \nminutes, and 2,000 kilometres with an orbital \nperiod of about 127 minutes. Objects below \napproximately 160 Km will experience very \nrapid orbital decay and altitude loss. The \norbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low \nEarth orbit is about 7.8 km/s, but reduces with \nincreased orbital altitude.",
    "2.2 Medium Earth Orbit – Medium Earth Orbit \n(MEO), sometimes called an intermediate \ncircular orbit (ICO), is the region of space \naround the Earth above low earth orbit at an \naltitude of 2000 Km and below geostationary \norbit of altitude 35,786 Km. \n \n \n                        \n                       Fig 2- Types of Orbits",

    "3. Why LEO Satellites? \nIn Low Earth Orbits, there are few \"universal orbits\" \nwhich keeps the spacecraft in some particular rings. \nLEO satellites can orbit in many planes, up to 15 times \nin a day, causing frequent approaches between higher \ndensity objects. Orbits of LEO are further changed \nby the phenomena of perturbations which in case of \nLEO include unevenness of the gravitational field of \nEarth's, and these collisions can occur from any \ndirection. For such reasons, the Kessler syndrome can \nbe applied mostly towards the LEO region. Impacts can \noccur at up to 16 km/s which is twice the orbital speed \nand \nif \ndealt \nhead \non \nlike \nthe 2009 \nsatellite \ncollision which \noccurred \nat",

Now with the time passing by, many space \nagencies launches many satellites every year for the \nease of human beings. With the ease, space junk is also \nincreasing. We need to take some action to prevent the \nincrease of debris. Removing 5-10 debris per year from \nLEO would slow down long term debris grown.

    "5.1. E-Sail- E-sail is the advanced method of propulsion \nwhich can be used to prevent the creation of debris \nby deorbiting at the end of the mission. The method \nis based on momentum transfer from the solar wind \nplasma stream, intercepted by long and charged \ntethers [1]. The electrostatic field created by the \ntethers deflects trajectories of solar wind protons so \nthat their flow-aligned momentum component \ndecreases. The flow-aligned momentum lost by the \nprotons is transferred to the charged tether by a \nCoulomb force (the charged tether is pulled by the \nplasma charge separation electric field) and then \ntransmitted to the spacecraft as thrust.",
    "5.2. Laser Ablation- When high energy laser irradiation \nforcing on the surface of debris, the surface would \nvaporize fleetingly and transform into steam mixing \nwith many plasma. The hyperthermal and high-\npressure steam sprays back in a round-shape, so the \ndebris gets moderating impulse because of \nmomentum exchange and then fall down [3].",

    "6. Mitigation \nSince we are the only ones creating the space debris, so \nwe are the only ones to take responsibilities to prevent \nit. We need to take some actions towards the future of \nspace exploration. In 2002, the Inter-Agency Debris \nCoordination Committee published the \"IADC Space \nDebris Mitigation Guidelines,\" and presented these to \nthe UNCOPUOS Scientific & Technical Subcommittee \n(STSC), where they served as a baseline for the \"UN \nSpace Debris Mitigation Guidelines.\" In 2007 these \nguidelines were approved by the 63 STSC member \nnations as voluntary high-level mitigation measures. \nSince the mid-1990s, space agencies in Europe have \ndeveloped more technically oriented guidelines as a \n\"European Code of Conduct,\" which was signed by \nASI, UKSA, CNES, DLR and ESA in 2006. \nThe core elements of this Code of Conduct are in line \nwith the IADC and UN guidelines. In order to tailor the \nCode of Conduct to the needs of ESA projects, ESA has \ndeveloped its own \"Requirements on Space Debris \nMitigation for Agency Projects\". These instructions \ncame into force on 1 April 2008. They are applicable to \nall future procurements of space systems (launchers, \nsatellites and inhabited objects). \n Limit the debris released during the normal \noperations \n Minimize the potentials for breakups during \noperational phases \n Limit the probability of accidental collision in \norbit by predicting the debris and orbital \ncalculation \n Avoid intentional destruction and other harmful \nactivities \n Limit the long term presence of satellite and \nlaunch vehicle orbital stages in LEO region \nafter end of mission \n All new satellite to be should be equipped with \nde-orbiting system so that after the lifespan of \nsatellite is over",
    "6. Conclusions  \nThe scope of this paper was to outline the basic \nchallenges faced by a LEO launched today due to the \npresence of space debris. We have tried to list out the \nbiggest problem that LEO satellites face today due to \nspace debris and also list some methods as to how the \ndebris problem can be solved. New propulsion systems \nlike the E-Sail etc. are a very important part of the \nsolution to space debris. \n \nWe also seek to establish some basic rules that have to \nbe followed by all new satellites that are launched now \nto help mitigate space debris. A de-orbiting component \nor mission objective needs to be added so at the end of \nlife of a satellite it can be de-orbited without \ncontributing to the amount of space junk already in the \nLEO.  \n \nA lot of research and development is needed in this area \nin the upcoming years if we are to mitigate the amount \nof space debris in the LEO. The big space agencies need \nto realize that space junk has become a very important \nissue and it can have a very bad impact on our future of \nspace exploration.  \n \nAcknowledgements  \nWe would like to thank our mentor Dr. Ugur Guven \nfor providing the resources needed for the research to be \nconducted.  \n \nReferences \n[1] Janhunen, P. and Sandroos, A.

The orbital environment is a major consideration in the design of any space system \nassociated with various hazards to earth orbiting satellites since it can have critical effect on spacecraft operations. \nVariation in solar environment also impact thermospheric density levels. The solar cycle also plays an important role \nin mission planning and operations activities. Solar flares are a major contributor to overall radiation environment \nand can add to dose of accumulated radiation levels. From the experimental satellites like SCATHA, CRRES and \nDMSP investigated the radiation environment of the inner and outer radiation belts and measured the state-of-art \nmicro-electronics devices. These hazards include differential charging, internal charging and surface charging which \ncan damage the spacecraft electronics. Solar storms and increased ultraviolet emissions heat earth’s upper \natmosphere causing it to expand, the heated air rises and density at the orbit of satellite increases significantly up to \nabout 1000 kilometres. This results in increase in drag causing satellite to slow down and change orbit slightly by as \nmuch as 30 kilometres, LEO satellite are not repeatedly boosted to higher orbits slightly fall and will eventually burn \nup. During storms the number and energy of electrons and ions increases. When the satellite travel through this \nenergized environment the charged particle striking the space craft differentially charge the portion of spacecraft. \nDischarges can arc across the spacecraft components, harming in possibly disabling them. If the sufficient charge \naccumulates in any one component, it may attempt to neutralize by discharging to other components. This discharge \nis hazardous to satellite electronic systems.

    "2. Origin of Energetic Solar Particles  \nSolar superstorms generates X-rays and solar radio \nbursts, accelerate solar particles ranging from few tens \nof KeV to GeV travelling at relativistic velocities and \ncause major perturbations to the solar wind. The fastest \nsolar particle can reach up to 80% of speed of light \n(0.8c). Most solar storms miss the earth, travelling \nharmlessly to space into space but some of them interact \nwith Earth’s environment and cause damage to satellites \n& disabling them. At the beginning of space age, our \nknowledge and understandings were limited, however, a \nnumber of near misses have caused major technological \ndamage to the man-made bodies. These solar particles \nare produced intermittently due to particle acceleration \nprocess known as Diffusive Shock Acceleration, \nsometime referred as First Order Fermi Acceleration \nand Shock Drift Mechanism in solar atmosphere \nassociated with solar flares, and in coronal and \ninterplanetary shocks created by the interaction of \ncoronal mass ejection (CMEs) with solar wind. An \nevolving CME may generate an interplanetary shock \nwhich propagates in space, deforming interplanetary \nmagnetic field (IMF) lines and draping them around \ndownstream of the shock. Solar Energetic Particles may \nescape from their acceleration sites and propagates \nalong the interplanetary magnetic field lines into \ninterplanetary space reaching the earth in less than an \nhour damaging the satellite structure, subsystem and \nbus.  \nFig 1: Schematics of Earth’s Magnetosphere \n \nThe plasma sphere environment is generally not a \nhazard to most spacecraft electronics. However it is \ndamaging to surface materials and differentials in the \nplasma environment can contribute to spacecraft \ncharging and discharging problems [1].",

The satellites in LEO \nare designed for military applications, scientific research \nand a growing number for satellite communication \nnetworks \n(e.g. \nIRIDUM, \nGLOBALSATAR, \nand \nORBCOM). In LEO, the satellite components and bus \nare subjected to an increased level of radiation due to \nenergetic particles trapped by earth’s magnetic field and \nencountering atmospheric drag from gases by increasing \nthe thermospheric density levels of the upper \natmosphere.

    "1. Satellite Charging- Satellite charging is the \nprimary cause of anomalies for the satellite \ncomponents \nin \nthe \nspace \nenvironment. \nCharging occurs when surrounding particles \nbombard the satellite and deposit the charge \nonto the satellite or even penetrate satellite \nshielding or deposits in internal components \n[1]. There are two types of satellite charging: \nSurface Charging and Internal Charging.",
    "1.1. Surface Charging: - Surface charging is caused \nby low energy electrons which are abundant in \ninner \nmagnetosphere \nduring \nthe \nmagnetospheric storm interacting with the \nsurface materials of the satellites. Surface \ncharging is most likely to occur between \nshadowed \nand \nsunlit \nsurfaces \nbecause \nphotoemission due to solar UV radiation \nejects low energy electron on sunlit surfaces. \nElectron with energies in few to tens of KeV \nrange can lead to charge build up on the \nsurface of satellite material. Electric fields due \nto differential charging on the satellite surface \ncan trap electron and make it difficult for \ncharge \nbalance \nto \noccur, \nleading \nto \nelectrostatic discharge and causing major \npower loss in the solar array.",
    "1.2. Internal Charging: - Internal charging is caused \nby high energy electrons which penetrate into \nthe satellite equipment depositing the charge \ninside insulating material and underground \nmetals. Internal charging is also known as \n“Deep Dielectric Charging”. Most high energy \nelectrons are concentrated in inner and outer \nelectron Van Allen Belts, making LEO \nsusceptible \n[5][6]. \nIf \nenough \nelectrical \npotential is builds between the internal \ncomponents, there could be an electrostatic \nbreakdown inside the circuitry of the satellite \nleading to anomalies in operation. Discharge \ntend to occur very close to sensitive and \nvulnerable components. Internal charging \nrequires a day of two of persistently high \nfluxes to build up enough charge to be a threat \noften occurring in storm.",
    "2. Total Iodizing Dose: - Total Iodizing Dose \noccurs due to solar electromagnetic radiation \nand by bombardment by charged particles \ncontributing to surface charging and internal \ncharging. The main radiation sources of \nionization are trapped electrons and protons of \nVan Allen Belts and solar flare protons. \nBuildup \nof \ncharge \ncan \ncause \ngradual \ndegradation of electronic performance and \nsolar cells efficiency. A common ionization \neffect is the gradual shift in the parameter of \nelectronic components leading to electronic \nfailures. So an accurate measurement of \naccumulated dose throughout satellite mission \nis necessary to optimize radiation shielding \ndesign for electronic components.",
    "3. Single Event Effects: - Single Event effect is \nnot caused by a gradual buildup of charge over \ntime as with internal or surface charging but \nimpact of an energetic proton from the sun that \ncan penetrate to the electronic circuitry and \nproduces changes in the electronic state of \nmemory chips by direct of the semiconductor \nand causing satellite failures either temporarily \nor permanently [2]. This phenomenon occurs \nwhen a high energy particle deposits sufficient \nenergy in sensitive volume of an electronic \ndevices to change a logic state of circuit.  \nSingle Event phenomenon can be classified \ninto various types: Single event Upset, Single \nEvent Latchup and Single Event Burnout. \nAlso, produces permanent and irreversible \ndegradation of solar arrays that power the \nsatellite. Effect ranges from correctable errors \nto permanent errors which includes burnout of \nsome devices. The high upset rates produced \nby SEPs are an increasing problem [3] and \n67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Guadalajara, Mexico, 26-30 September 2016.  \nCopyright ©2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

    "4. Atmospheric Drag: - An Energetic Solar \nParticles will cause Earth’s atmosphere to \nswell to higher altitudes. This can increase the \natmospheric drag and alter low altitude satellite \norbits and prediction of satellites orbit will be \ndegraded [4]. In extreme cases, low altitude \nsatellite may experience aerodynamic torque \nwhich overcome the satellite’s attitude control \nsystem capability leading to termination of the \nmission as happened to ASTRO-D nearly 450 \nKM of altitude during the storm of 14-15 July",
    "2000.Satellite in LEO passes through relatively \ndense particles near auroral zone at a relative \nvelocity of 8 KM/s exchanging the impulse and \nenergy between ambient atmosphere and \nsatellite causing drag on satellite. The height of \nthermosphere lies about 90 KM during solar \nminimum and climb to about 1000 KM during \nsolar maximum, At approximately 200-250 km \nthis temperature approaches a limiting value, \nthe average value of which ranges between \nabout 600 and 1,200 K over a typical solar \ncycle. The large variation implies that the \nsatellites will decay more rapidly during \nperiods of solar maxima and much more slowly \nduring solar minima. As thermosphere expands \ndue to increased absorption of solar radiations, \ncausing drag at higher altitudes. In long run, if \nnot compensated, drag causes satellite to slow, \nlose altitude and finally re-enter before the \nmission completes. \n \nFig 2- Satellite Drag Measurement",
    "5. Satellite Failures and Outrages \nProtection of satellite are done in number of ways. \nPhysical shielding is done at acceptable levels to \nequipment components and satellites to reduce the \nparticle \nfluxes \naccumulating \nthe \nsatellite. \nMicroelectronics are selected in such a way \naccounting some degree of degradation and \nunwanted behaviour. There should be redundant \nsystem to cope up with single failures. Problems \nresulting from solar energetic particles have proven \nimpossible to decrease all together despite all the \nengineering measures taken care of. There’s always \na massive storm accelerating the solar energetic \nparticles directed towards Earth like the storm of \n2003, also known as “Halloween Storm” impacting \n23 satellites, 4 permanent damages and 3 loss of \nfunctionality. Below is the table listing the number \nof LEO satellites impacted during the solar events.  \n \nTable 2- Satellite Failures \nS No. \nDate \nSatellite \nCause \n(Probable) \n1 \n2009 \nHubble Space \nTelescope \nHigh \nEnergy \nParticles \n2 \nOct 2003 \nADEOS-1 \nAtmospheric \ndrag \n3 \nJan 1986 \nSolar \nMaximum \nMission \nCosmic Ray \n4 \nOct 1988 \nFY-1 \nESD \n5 \nJuly 2000 \nAstro-D \nAtmospheric \ndrag \n6 \nOct 2003 \nMidori II \nAtmospheric \ndrag",
    "6. Mitigation \nIt is important to understand the mitigation of energetic \nsolar particle so as to avoid anomalies as much as \npossible since most satellite are unable to withstand the \nfluxes of high energetic charged particles. The effect of \nsolar particles can be mitigated by: \n Shielding of sensitive instruments inside the \nsatellite such that it is protected by structure \n Selection of radiation hardened electronics part \nand materials \n Irradiation tests like TID test, SEE tests etc. \nshould be done prior to the launch \n There should be a redundant system in case of \na single system failure \n Implementation of error detection, analysis and \ncorrection \n Use of low resistivity materials to avoid \nsatellite charging",
    "7. Conclusion \nThus it can be concluded that solar particles are a \nmajor factor in the life expectancy of a LEO satellite \ndue to the deterioration caused by these particles. \nMitigation and solutions for the effect must be therefore \n67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Guadalajara, Mexico, 26-30 September 2016.  \nCopyright ©2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

In fact, since Tsiolkovsky or even since Jules Verne, mankind has been looking for various means to go into \nspace. Currently this has been achieved through the works of several space agencies and many nations have been \nable to send an astronaut into space in collaboration with various space programs. However, most of these have been \ndone through the act of governments and thus such endeavours are limited by fiscal spending. We know from the \nhistory of aviation that the major reason for the boom of the aviation industry was actually the advancements of \nairports and through the spending of private investors. When airports became widespread and when private investors \ninvested in airports and airlines, this caused a certain boom which continues even today. For spaceflight a similar \nsituation is required as it is important to have private investors invest in spaceflight like Virgin Galactic so that the \ncost of space travel can go down and that it can become widespread among the public. However, the greatest \nchallenge lies in the availability of spaceports to make spaceflight available to companies as well as the public. \nWhile several spaceports across the globe exist, they belong to governments and thus there are severe restrictions in \ntheir usage. This paper talks about the importance of spaceports and talks about the logistical requirements such as \ngeography, power infrastructure, local infrastructure and environmental feasibility. Several trajectory calculations \nrelated to spaceports which can be placed at various locations across the globe such as South Africa, Venezuela, \nSouth Pacific are also given to help reinforce the concept. This way, the economic feasibility of each spaceflight can \nbe determined with further research. This paper is intended to shed light on this concept and pave the way for further \nresearch into spaceports. \n \nKeywords: Spaceport, rocket launch, commercial spaceflight, private spaceports, space tourism, orbital trajectory \n \nNomenclature \n \nIsp = Specific Impulse \nVe = Exhaust velocity",
    "1. Introduction \nSpace technology has been progressing greatly in the \n \nlast 50 years. However, one of the good news for the \nglobal space community is that the private sector has \nbeen very active especially in the last 10-15 years in \ngetting involved in space related activities including bit \nnot limited to space tourism. \n \nThis interest is evident in different platforms. For \nexample, Google and SpaceX foundation has put \nforward Google Lunar X prize where the winning team \nhas to put a special robot on the moon and then the \nrobot has to travel for at least 500 meters and it has to \nsend some scientific data including images back to the \nground station on Earth. The winning team can receive \nup to 40 Million US Dollars but the team must win \nwithout any official government support. Hence, it \n \nneeds to be won by space entrepreneurs and private \ncompanies that will compete for this prize. For example, \nTeam Indus which is an Indian entity made up of \nstudents, \nretired \nspace \nengineers \nand \nspace \nentrepreneurs is doing quite well as they won the 1 \nMillion USD Milestone Prize. This competition clearly \nshows that private sector is given a chance to prove \nthemselves in a complex mission like a Moon Mission. \n \nOn the other hand, one of the issues in global space \ncommunity is that they have stopped using Space \nShuttles to transport materials into space including \nhuman payload and cargo. While NASA and the \nRussian Space Agency continue to send materials with \nboth manned and unmanned rockets, it is heartening to \nsee companies like Space X getting involved in cargo \ntransportation to space as the work is outsourced by \nNASA. Another company called DHL to the Moon \npromises to send your payload to the moon in their \nperiodic moon transport service. There are many \ncompanies like Team Indus that also proclaim to send \nyour cargo to the Moon. Hence, all of these private \n \n \n \nIAC-17,B3,2,8,x37512 \nPage 1 of 8 \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017. \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \n \ncompanies that are interested in such endeavours can \nreally make this sector interesting. \n \nOf course, in the space tourism front, there are lots \nof activities happening in the private sector as well. For \nexample, Sir Richard Bronson is investing heavily for \nhis company Virgin Galactic which will take passengers \nregularly to sub orbital flights so that these passengers \ncan experience weightlessness and also see the \ncurvature of the Earth from space. While he had some \nsetbacks with accidents related to his spacecraft, it is \nexpected that within the next 5 years this flight to \nsuborbital altitudes will become possible by the private \nsector. There are also many other companies that \nproclaim to send humans to even higher altitudes if \nenough money is given. In addition, example like Mars1 \nmission can also be discussed where the company \nproposes to create a habitat on Mars by sending people \nthere. \n \nAll of these activities are very encouraging but \nalmost all of them will require private spaceports to \nbecome possible so that these different type of \nspacecraft can be launched by private means with \ngovernment supervision. This paper is intended into a \nbasic research on spaceports on different locations of \nthe Earth for private use. Several case studies are given \nwith orbital parameters to demonstrate their utilization \nfrom their launching points on Earth. The paper doesn’t \ngo into much detail into infrastructure and other \nlogistics as that will be the scope of another paper.",
    "2. The Fundamentals of Spaceports \n \nBasically, a spaceport can be defined as an \ninstallation that can be used to launch rockets and other \nspacecraft into space. The word spaceport is derived \nfrom the word airport and it symbolizes the whole \ninfrastructure and the installation required to launch \nrockets into space. The existing spaceports today are \ncalled launch sites and they are owned and operated by \ngovernments.",
    "2.1 Existing Spaceports (Launch Sites) \n \nThere are several existing spaceports in operation \ntoday by the USA, Russia, France, China and India. \nCape Kennedy in USA is perhaps the most famous \nspaceport as majority of launches in the world are \nconducted from there and it was also home to the \nfamous Space Shuttle launches. It was named after the \nthen President John F. Kennedy who had the vision of \nlanding on the Moon. It was made ready for space \nlaunches in 1950 which marks its first launch, lifting off \nthe Bumper 8 rocket on July 24. Ever since then Cape \nKennedy has been home to more than 3000 rockets \nnow. It has been a witness to the success of NASA’s \nMercury and Gemini missions, all the Apollo flights \nusing Saturn 1 and Skylab, the Mars exploration rovers, \nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and all the benchmarks \n \nof excellence and teamwork that the country has been \nable to achieve at this spaceport. Initially until the sixth \nBumper series rocket, the White Sands at New Mexico \nhad been the launch site, where the war missiles had \nbeen launching. With the need to achieve longer range \nrockets, Span Starr, the then chief of Applied Physics at \nthe Kennedy Space Centre realized the potential of Cape \nKennedy. It attracted the attention because of two prime \nreasons: i) it is much closer to the equator, being 28 \ndegrees latitude above the equator (relatively closer than \nthe other US locations). This is a benefit since the \nvelocity of the Earth’s rotation is much greater at the \nequator, hence saving the rocket on fuel consumption. \nThe eastward rotation of the Earth combined with an \neastward directed launch velocity of the rocket \naccelerates the travel relieving the propulsion system; ii) \nIt is near the east coast of the geography, close to the \nisland with a much sparsely populated area. This assures \nsafety to the relatively habited land and also safety \nduring accidents as the malfunction will end up crashing \ninto the waters of the island itself. This region is prone \nto precipitation, wind and lightening, despite which it is \nNASA’s prime choice. This is because it is relatively \nsafer as compared to the other hurricane prone or \ncyclone prone areas in the US. The above two major \naspects more than compensate for reasons as to why \nCape Kennedy is the best site to open America’s \nwindows to the cosmos. It is declared as the Long \nRange Proving Ground. \n \nThe Russians use the Baikonur Facility to launch \ntheir rockets. The lands of Baikonur have seen birth of \nthe space missions and the subsequent milestones that \ncount as “first ever” in space history; first space launch-\nSputnik 1 in 1954, first man in space , first moon \nmission , first female in space, first crewed mission in \nspace. Today the site marks the launches of all the \nSoyuz rockets and the Russian cosmonauts to the ISS. \nThe area is essentially remote thus reducing the risk to \nhuman population. The spaceport is located on a desert \nsteppe east of the Aral Sea. It is an area of harsh climate \nand may not show geographical inclinations leading to \nits set up. However, existence of an already established \nfacility to transport material for manufacture and rockets \nthemselves motivated its construction in 1955. The area \nensures reachable control by Russia and is capable to \nlaunch larger boosters. \n \nFrance launches its rockets from Guiana which is \ncapable of launching a variable range of rockets such as \nthe heavy-lift Ariane 5, medium size Soyuz and \nlightweight Vega. It is operational since 1968. \nGeographically, this site holds the most potential. It is \nvery close to the equator, a little over 5 degrees which is \nadvantageous for saving fuel and money just as Cape \nKennedy, except it is comparatively much closer. Thus, \nit is cost effective and saves fuel. Moreover, it is highly \nremote. Its geographical location is so ideal that it is \n \n \n \nIAC-17,B3,2,8,x37512 \nPage 2 of 8 \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017. \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \n \npossible to achieve almost all types of orbits from this \nsite. Its launch angle of 102 degrees caters to mission \nform east to north. It is much less prone to earthquakes \nor cyclones. With such high reliability, it attracts launch \nprojects from other countries such as Japan, Canada, \nIndia and Brazil. It is the world’s most modern \nspaceport. \n \nChina holds a considerable area on the map and thus \nrelies on over four launch sites- Wenchang Spacecraft \nLaunch Site, Xichang Spacecraft Launch Centre, \nJiuquan Satellite Launch Centre and Taiyuan Satellite \nLaunch Centre. Wenchang is southernmost among the \nfour, and closest to the equator with latitude being 19 \ndegrees. Transport of materials is done by sea. The site \nwas ready to launch rockets by 2014. High thrust \nrockets as well as geostationary orbit satellites are \nlaunched from Xichang. Jinquan holds significant \nimportance as it is the site responsible for the successful \nhuman flights from China. China’s first manned mission \nhad \nbeen \nachieved \nhere. \nMeteorological \nand \ncommunication satellites along with satellites of sun-\nsynchronous orbit are released at Taiyuan. These four \nsites are ideal in the sense that they prevent civilian \nintervention in keeping with their safety and hold their \nexclusive geographical importance in terms of being \nfavourable for the particular orbit and trajectory that is \naimed. \n \nIndia’s space launch site is at the Satish Dhawan \nSpace Centre (SDSC) and is called the Sriharikota High \nAltitude Range (SHAR) rocket launching centre. It is a \nstrategic location on an island in the Bay of Bengal and \nkeeps away from civilians. Its latitude is a little over 13 \ndegrees making it close to the equator. The launch \nrecord from this site reflects successful launches of \npolar, geosynchronous and low earth orbits of satellites. \nIt is not just a facility for launch, the SDSC manages the \nassembly, fuelling and checkout of the rockets. Again, it \nis near to the equator and remote. It has good road and \nrail connectivity for favouring logistics with nearby \ncities. It is accessible via land, sea and air. Heavy rains \noccur between October and November making it ideal \nfor the rest of the year. It currently has two launching \npads that have accelerated the potential of the launch \nsite. The centre has launched a series of PSLVs and \nGSLVs. The space port has witnessed important \nmissions such as he Chandrayaan missions and the Mars \nOrbiter Mission.",
    "2.1 Fundamental Requirements of a Spaceport \n \nIn order for a spaceport to exist, there are certain \nparameters that will need to be fulfilled. Of course, the \nspaceport will need to be placed in a strategical location \nthat is environmentally friendly and also that it should \nhave \nthe \nnecessary \ninfrastructure \nsuch \nas \nthe \ntransportation logistics to and from the launch site, \nsufficient power for the operation of the launch site, \n \navailability of emergency services at the spaceport as \nwell. Usually most launch sites are constructed near \nwater or sea or ocean for safety purposes in case the \nrocket explodes after few seconds into the launch. \n \nOf course, when we are talking about a commercial \nspaceport, then it is more than a government launch site \nas it will be serving space tourism as well. Hence, the \nrequirements for a full scale spaceport will be much \nmore than a launch site as the facilities that will be \nrequired for the space tourism passengers will also need \nto be incorporated into the spaceport.",
    "3. Case Studies of Possible Global Spaceports Several \nlocations have been studied within the scope \n \nof this paper to determine optimal parameters for a \nspaceport that has been chosen. The main criteria have \nbeen the orbital mechanics parameters to understand \nhow long it will take for the spacecraft to reach either \nsub orbital altitudes as well as for Low Earth Orbit \naltitudes. NASA GMAT Software (General Mission \nAnalysis Tool) has been used for the simulations for \neach case study for a spaceport.",
    "3.1 Case Study for Mauritius \n \nThe first case study has been for Mauritius as it has \nbeen chosen for its location as it is ideally located in the \nIndian Ocean in the Southern Hemisphere. Basically, it \nis an island country in the Indian Ocean off the South \nEast coast of Africa. The geographical location makes it \nquite safe due to orbital path of the launched spacecraft \nas in an emergency it can fall or land on the ocean. It is \nfar away from perturbations which makes it ideal for a \nlaunch site. \n \nOf course, some disadvantages exist such as the fact \nthat the power infrastructure of the island may not be \nsufficient for a spaceport and also there may be \nenvironmental concerns related to fauna and flora of the \nisland. Naturally, a detailed environmental impact report \nwill need to be prepared before this location can be \ndeemed as environmentally compatible for a spaceport. \nThe coordinates have been chosen on the Northern most \ntip of the island. \n \nLatitude: -20.023° \nLongitude: 57.679° \n \nThe coordinates which are taken into account in this \ncase study serves the best purpose because the \npopulation density is negligible. These locations are \nnear to the equator so as the space craft has to travel a \nvery less distance to reach the orbit of the Earth. The \npower required to run the Space port is challenge at the \ngiven location but this can be overcome by installing \nlarge arrays of solar panels the nearby areas.

Since mankind was able to gaze into the stars at the dawn of civilization, he has looked for a way to reach \nthose stars. Unfortunately, due to slow technological advancements as well as due to dwindling public support; the \nprospects for interstellar exploration for the 21st century look grim. There are many exotic types of propulsion \nmethods which have been proposed, but in actuality the only really available and feasible technology that we have \ncurrently is nuclear propulsion. While there are several studies going parallel across the world for interstellar travel \ntechniques such as ion propulsion and even warp drive, still nuclear propulsion seems to be most feasible in terms of \nboth technological feasibility and economic feasibility. Also, while fusion as nuclear propulsion seems to be \npromising, the problems related to fusion shield containment and the control of the fusion reaction at the levels \nneeded is problematic.  One alternative is the utilization of nuclear propulsion using a gas core reactor with 10,000K \nworking temperature, which theoretically allows very high specific impulses as well as high acceleration rates. \nEspecially with non-manned missions, it would allow special acceleration rates which could make interstellar \nmissions feasible from time period of view. This paper will present the method of gas core nuclear propulsion with \ndetailed simulation results of the gas core as well as the exit of the rocket nozzle. Furthermore, specific impulse \ncalculations, as well as a sample calculation for an interstellar mission is included to show its feasibility in terms of \nenergy expenditure. It is interesting to note that this method is certainly within a realm of 2 decades meaning that it \ncan be implemented with a solid 20 year plan with a feasible budget that is doable by today’s standards. The paper \nwill discuss this in detail with some possible recommendations for advancement in the future for interstellar travel \npossibilities. The paper also will establish a baseline for similar proposals to set a precedent for unmanned \ninterstellar missions with today’s capability.  \nKeywords: Interstellar Flight, Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Gas Core Propulsion, Nuclear Flight, Interstellar Probe, \nInterstellar Mission \n \nNomenclature \nIsp  = Specific Impulse \nVe \n= Exhaust velocity \nUF6 = Uranium Hexafluoride \n \nAcronyms/Abbreviations \nLWPR: Light Water Pressurized Reactor \nHWPR: Heavy Water Pressurized Reactor \nGCR   : Gas Core Nuclear Reactor",
    "1. Introduction \nDreaming about the stars is probably one of the main \ndriving forces of the mankind since the dawn of the \ncivilization. Naturally, as a result going to space and \ndreaming about interstellar destinations has been a \nsignificant part of the science fiction genre. However, \nactually travelling there would be very difficult due to \nrestrictions in today’s technology. Contrary to the \npopular belief, the spacecraft of today are not \nsophisticated at all and they are based on the old Soyuz \nand Apollo designs. As a result, they are severely \nlimited by chemical propulsion which can hardly \nprovide transport mechanism until the moon and not \nreally further for a manned mission. \nOf course, there are several different advanced \npropulsion techniques which are available and many \nscientists and engineers are currently working on how to \ncontrol different technologies to allow for more \nadvanced \ntravel. \nObviously, \nnuclear \npropulsion \ntechniques and ion propulsion are two advanced \npropulsion techniques that are being considered by \nmany scientists.  \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

This paper focuses on advanced \ngas core nuclear reactors using Uranium Hexafluoride \nas a nuclear fissile material and diatomic hydrogen as a \npropellant.",
    "2. Nuclear Propulsion Fundamentals  \nThe fundamental principle of rocket propulsion \ncomes from the Newton’s Laws of Action Equals \nReaction. Thus in a typical propulsion system where \nyou may be ejecting something, then the main way to \ncreate the exhaust velocity in a rocket would be to have \na high temperature in the chamber which would excite \nthe molecules and cause them to get ejected.  The \nspecific impulse of a rocket is given by: \n \ng\nV\nJ\nI\ne\nsp\n\n\n2\n             \n(1) \nWhere: \nJ: Energy Potential \nVe: Exhaust velocity \n \nThe rocket equation for exhaust velocity for ideal \ngases is given by: \n         (2) \n     Where: \n     Ue: Exhaust Velocity \n      Tc: Combustion Chamber Temperature \n \nThus, as it can be seen from the equations, the \nprimary method of faster propulsion would be to obtain \nhigher temperatures in the combustion chamber. \nHowever, since the combustion chamber would have \nlimited heat capacity due to limitations of chemical \nprocessing, this is where nuclear thermal propulsion \nwould come in. \nBasically, nuclear thermal propulsion is obtained by \nhaving a fission reaction to generate heat instead of a \nchemical reaction. As per Einstein’s equation below: \n \n \n \nE = mc2 \n \n \n(3) \n \nMass can be converted into energy. This is partially \nwhat happens in a fission reaction as a fissile material is \nfragmented into two parts and by products in a nuclear \nreaction. The equation for a typical general fission can \nbe seen below: \n \n   (4)\n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, it must be noted that the right side of the \nequation would have lesser total mass then the left side \nof the equation. The remaining mass difference would \nbe converted into energy and this energy is expressed as \nheat energy. Thus, this allows the heat energy to be \nreleased in a more significant fashion then chemical \nenergy as per equation (3). The typical Nuclear Rocket \nwould have a design as shown below: \n \n \nFig. 1. Typical Nuclear Rocket Design \n \n      As a result, the overall temperature would be higher \nwhich would cause a higher exhaust velocity which \nwould mean a higher specific impulse as per equation (). \nHowever, even a classic nuclear fission reaction would \nhave limitations in terms of the heat that can be obtained, \nso it is essential to focus on more advanced forms of \nnuclear propulsion. One such method is using gaseous \nnuclear fissile materials such as Uranium Hexafluoride \nas compared to solid or liquid fissile materials. Research \nsuggests that the overall heat production would be \nsignificantly higher than classical fission reaction.",
    "3. Gaseous Nuclear Core and Propulsion \nGaseous core nuclear reactor is quite different from \na regular nuclear reactor which uses zirconium coated \nnuclear fuel rods containing Uranium 235 pellets. In \nessence, the nuclear fuel is not in a solid state in a \ngaseous core nuclear reactor and it is rather in a gaseous \nstate. Usually, Uranium Tetrafluoride or Uranium \nHexafluoride is used as a gaseous fuel for these reactors \nand naturally fission kinetics will be very different. The \nreflectors can be the same as solid fuelled nuclear \nreactors but obviously there won’t be an option to use \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

The overall \nheat properties of a gaseous core nuclear reactor will be \nmuch more than a regular LWPR and thus this makes \nthem preferable for high heat missions.

    "3.1 Moderator of a Gaseous Core Reactor \nThe moderator that is chosen for these types of gas \ncore reactors is generally hydrogen due to its more \nfavourable neutron cross section ratio. The hydrogen is \nin gaseous format as well in order to maintain the \ncontrol of the system [10]. However, hydrogen has to be \nin pure form without any H20 or D20, so that volatile \nreaction will not take place inside the reactor chamber. \nAbout 100 parts of hydrogen per 1 part of Uranium \nTetra Fluoride is recommended for ideal homogenized \ndistribution of the moderator with the gaseous reactor \nfuel.",
    "3.2 Reflector of a Gaseous Core Reactor \n The reflector can be Beryllium Oxide (BeO) to \nsurround the reaction chamber in order to prevent the \nneutrons from escaping outside the nuclear reactor \nchamber. The optimal geometry for Beryllium oxide for \nfission neutronics dictates that it should be between 30 \ncm to 50 cm thickness, below these levels, the criticality \nmaintenance becomes a problem and above these levels, \nthe thermal spectrum of the neutrons becomes too soft \n[9]. It is also possible to create the reflector in such a \nway so that the columns will be made in a rotating \nmanner [4]. This will change the reflection rate of the \nneutrons in the reactor; which can also help in the \ncontrol of the process [8].",
    "3.3 Gaseous Core Fission Control \nIf the amount of pressure in the gaseous reactor core \nis kept intentionally high, then the amount of Uranium \nHexafluoride molecules that are available for fission \nwill be more in abundance and the cross sections will be \nfavorable towards fission [6]. In the case, where the \npressure is kept intentionally low, then this can reduce \nthe amount of fission reaction, so that the reactivity of \nthe gaseous core can be kept under control. Hence, by \nusing pressure control, it is quite easy to control the \nfission reactivity inside this system [7].",
    "3.4 Propulsion Control \nAs discussed above, the propulsion would depend on \nthe heat of the reactor which would energize the \ndiatomic hydrogen molecules which are being used as a \nrocket propellant in an interstellar nuclear propelled \nspacecraft. As the heat inside the chamber reaches high \ntemperatures, this will excite the hydrogen molecules \nmore and more which will cause higher speeds at the \nexhaust of the rocket. This in turn leads to higher \nexhaust velocity which also leads to higher specific \nimpulses. Technically, by controlling the rate of fission \nin the gaseous core chamber, the temperature of the \nhydrogen propellant can be controlled which would lead \nto the control of the speed of the propellant as well. It \nmust be mentioned that controlling the pressure of the \nreactor core system can also have an effect on the \nexhaust velocity as well. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3. Temperature Profile Simulation in GCR \n \nThere are several studies to suggest that gaseous \ncore nuclear reactors can allow up to 10,000K of \ntemperatures to be reached easily and this can easily \ncause very high temperature and velocity profiles to be \nreached for hydrogen which would lead to higher \nexhaust velocity and a higher specific impulse in order \nof 1000s of seconds. Simulation of a suggested GCR \ndesign showing the temperature profile can be seen in \nFigure 3.

Conclusions  \nOverall, this paper aims to demonstrate the \npossibility of using Gas Core Nuclear Reactors (GCR) \nfor interstellar travel to nearby destinations generally \nwithin 10 light years of our solar system.

The cosmic speed limit is the velocity of light, 186,282 miles (299,792,458 \nmeters) per second. Conventional Rockets are far too slow to allow humans to travel between the stars in a single \nlifetime. Indeed, Even the closest star is more than 266,000 times more distant away than our own sun. Light, the \nfastest thing known, takes only eight minutes to travel to the Earth from the sun, but requires more than four years to \nget to the nearest star. To reach the dark gap, the black hole, at the focal point of the Milky Way Galaxy, light would \ntake 30,000 years. Even the fastest humans and spacecraft launched this far would take thousands of years to reach \nthe closest stars. Speeds about 75 times quicker than this would be required if we hope to make an interstellar trip in \nless than a 100 years. Be that as it may, no law of physics makes the trip impossible in theory. The past twenty-five \nyears have brought forth an uprising in planet-finding, with thousands of known, confirmed planets, including many \nof the potentially habitable, Earth-like worlds. But could we ever get there? There are physics loopholes that could \nallow faster than light travel. If we wanted it badly enough, interstellar travel could be achievable in our lifetime. \nTo achieve this final goal requires securing the needed technical, financial, educational and motivational assistance. \nA new, sustainable approach must be implemented, one that can stand the trial of time and remain focused on the \nultimate goal. A Master Plan, a calendar and a rundown of beneficial exercises derived from important spinoffs are \nrecorded and assessed. This visionary but practical paper will discuss about a STARSHIP which is able to travel at a \nsubstantial measure of the light speed by using an advanced and exotic propulsion mechanism and take us beyond \nthe solar system in search for evolution, development and to be prepared for the FUTURE. \nKeywords : Interstellar, Starship, Speed of Light \n \nAbbreviations \nBH- Black Hole \nHR- Hawkings Radiations",
    "1. Introduction \n \nInterstellar travel is the term used for hypothetical \npiloted or unpiloted travel between stars or planetary \nsystems. Interstellar travel will be much more difficult \nthan interplanetary spaceflight; the distances between \nthe planets in the Solar System are less than 30 \nastronomical \nunits \n(AU)—whereas \nthe \ndistances \nbetween stars are typically hundreds of thousands of AU, \nand usually expressed in light-years. Because of the \nvastness of those distances, interstellar travel would \nrequire a high percentage of the speed of light; huge \ntravel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer; \nor a combination of both. \n \nThe speeds required for interstellar travel in a human \nlifetime far exceed what current methods of spacecraft \npropulsion can provide. Even with a hypothetically \nperfectly efficient propulsion system, the kinetic energy \ncorresponding to those speeds is enormous by today's \nstandards of energy production. Moreover, collisions by \nthe spacecraft with cosmic dust and gas can produce \nvery dangerous effects both to passengers and the \nspacecraft itself. \n \nA number of strategies have been proposed to deal \nwith these problems, ranging from giant arks that would \ncarry entire societies and ecosystems, to microscopic \nspace probes. Many different spacecraft propulsion \nsystems have been proposed to give spacecraft the \nrequired speeds, including nuclear propulsion, beam-\n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Even the most optimistic views about \ninterstellar travel see it as only being feasible decades \nfrom now—the more common view is that it is a \ncentury or more away. However, in spite of the \nchallenges, if interstellar travel should ever be realized, \nthen a wide range of scientific benefits can be expected. \n \nMost interstellar travel concepts require a developed \nspace logistics system capable of moving millions of \nmetric tons to a construction / operating location, and \nmost \nwould \nrequire \ngigawatt \nscale \npower \nfor \nconstruction or power (such as Star Wisp or Light Sail \ntype concepts). Such a system could grow organically if \nspace-based \nsolar \npower \nbecame \na \nsignificant \ncomponent of Earth's energy mix. Consumer demand \nfor a multi-terawatt system would automatically create \nthe necessary multi-million metric ton/year logistical \nsystem. [1]",
    "1.1 Current Problems and Objectives \nWhile tending to the interstellar problem, the prompt \nissue that surfaces is distance. Since, Transit time is \nproportional to distance, the only one way one can get \nto the distant stars in a brief length of time is to go \nquick. This then points out to the most vital issue related \nwith interstellar travel – Propulsion. \nWhat any propulsion system aims to achieve is high \nexhaust velocity energy release so as to lead to a high \nvelocity of the spacecraft. Also, that energy should be \nlasting long enough for the spacecraft to travel through \ninterstellar space and achieve its goal. \nA BH will provide a consistent fuel source to the \nstarship, provide moderate to high acceleration, \nreasonable cruise duration of order decades and perhaps \nreaching the nearby stars within a human life",
    "1.2 Black Hole \nA Black Hole is a place in space where gravity pulls \nso much that even light cannot get out. The gravity is so \nstrong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny \nspace. This can happen when a star is dying. Because no \nlight can get out, people can't see BHs. They are \ninvisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help \nfind BHs. The special tools can see how stars that are \nvery close to BHs act differently than other stars.  \n \n \n \nFigure 1: BH and its Event Horizon",
    "1.3 Artificial BH \nA BH can be artificially created by man. To create a \nBH we need to concentrate a tremendous amount of \nenergy into a tiny volume. The resulting million-tonne \nBH would be about the size of an atomic nucleus which \nis artificially created.",
    "1.4 Starship \nA starship, starcraft or interstellar spacecraft is a \ntheoretical spacecraft designed for traveling between \nplanetary systems, as opposed to an aerospace-vehicle \ndesigned for orbital spaceflight or interplanetary travel.",
    "1.5 Concept for Black Hole Starship \nThe starship will have a BH at the back of the crew \nquarters whose gravity will pull matter, energy and even \nlight towards it, which will hit the C60 shield \nsurrounding the BH and provide momentum to the ship, \nat a fraction of the speed of light. Also, The BH will be \nemitting Hawking’s Radiations which will be harnessed \nby a HR absorbing Sphere placed just inside the C60 \nshield. This energy will be used to provide exhaust to \nthe ship. This way, the fuel supply to the starship \nremains persistent. [2]",
    "2. Material and methods  \nBHs are stars that have burnt out and collapsed \nunder their own gravity to an infinitesimally small point \nin space – a singularity. Inside the so-called event \nhorizon, even light is trapped by a huge gravitational \npull. So BHs were once thought of as barren plugholes, \nwhere nothing could escape – as energy drains rather \nthan energy sources. \nBut that view evolved once Stephen Hawking and \nothers brought quantum physics into the mix. Hawking \nshowed in the 1970s that BHs should emit energy from \ntheir boundaries in the form of radiation produced by \nquantum fluctuations of empty space itself. Eventually \nthe BH radiates itself away – it evaporates. \nThis radiation is emitted very slowly, however. \nMight it be possible to induce a BH to release all its \nHawking radiation sooner, so that in effect it becomes \nlike a ball of fuel? That’s not idle or quasi-magical \nspeculation, for physicists have believed for at least 30 \nyears that it might be possible. \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \nIAC-17-F1.2.3                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 3 of 4 \nIn 1983 physicists George Unruh and Robert Wald \nsuggested lowering some form of energy-collecting \ndevice – we can think of it simply as a ―box‖ for \ncapturing radiation – from a distant point to close to the \nhole’s event horizon, where it would fill up with \nHawking radiation. You could then bring it back up \nagain, just like filling a bucket with water from a well. \nPerformed \nrepeatedly, \nthis \nmanoeuvre \nwould \ngradually strip the BH of its ―hot atmosphere‖ of \nradiation. In principle more energy can be extracted per \nsecond from a single BH than is radiated from all the \nordinary stars in the observable universe.  \nThe BH will be placed at the back of the Starship, \nenclosed by a HR absorbing Sphere which will harness \nthe Hawking’s radiation radiated by the BH. The HR \nabsorbing \nSphere \nwill \nbe \nenclosed \nby \na \nBuckminsterfullerine C60 shield which will shield \nmatter from falling into the BH. The Event Horizon of \nthe BH will be inside the HR absorbing Sphere and the \nshield.  \n \n \nFigure 2: BH Powered Starship",
    "3. Theory and calculation \nIn Einstein's universe, the relativistic effect known \nas time dilation may allow long journeys in human \nlifetimes. Time moves more slowly in a moving frame \nthan a stationary frame. A clock in the moving star ship \nwill run more slowly than a clock on Earth according to \nthe equation: \n                δTearth = γ·δTship                         (1) \nwhere, \n          __________ \nγ = 1 / √ 1 - v2/c2 \nv - velocity of the star ship \nc - speed of light in vacuum = 299,792,458 \n[meters/second] \n \nNote that as v gets closer to c, the term γ approaches \ninfinity. The effect of time dilation is negligible at small \nvelocities but increases asymptotically as the velocity of \nthe star ship approaches the speed of light. Note how the \nkinetic energy becomes extremely large.  \nBesides this, there are many other practical problems \nin realizing a star ship such as hitting small dust \nparticles while moving at relativistic velocities.  \nThe Luminosity of a BH is a function of mass M. \n \nInterstellar Travel: Dependency in specific Impulse \nThe fundamentals of rocket propulsion, it can be \nunderstood that it is essential for very high specific \nimpulses as well as high acceleration levels to be \nprovided so that proper results can be achieved. The \nspecific impulse of a spacecraft depends directly on the \nenergy density (J) of the flow that is being utilized.[3] \n             Isp = √(2J) = Ve/g              (2) \n             \nWhere, J= Specific Potential \nA specific impulse below 10,000 would not even be \ndiscussable as an interstellar travel would take a very \nlong time, which could not be manageable by any \nstandards concerning life support as well as the logistics \nof the spacecraft.",
    "4. Fast Missions \n              If a spaceship could average 10 percent of light \nspeed (and decelerate at the destination, for manned \nmissions), this would be enough to reach Proxima \nCentauri in forty years. Several propulsion concepts \nhave been proposed  that might be eventually developed \nto accomplish this (see also the section below on \npropulsion methods), but none of them are ready for \nnear-term (few decades) development at acceptable cost",
    "5. Time Dilation \n             Assuming faster-than-light travel is impossible, \none might conclude that a human can never make a \nround-trip farther from Earth than 20 light years if the \ntraveler is active between the ages of 20 and 60. A \ntraveler would never be able to reach more than the very \nfew star systems that exist within the limit of 20 light \nyears from Earth. This, however, fails to take into \naccount time dilation.Clocks aboard an interstellar ship \nwould run slower than Earth clocks, so if a ship's \nengines were capable of continuously generating around \n1 g of acceleration (which is comfortable for humans), \nthe ship could reach almost anywhere in the galaxy and \nreturn to Earth within 40 years ship-time (see diagram). \nUpon return, there would be a difference between the \ntime elapsed on the astronaut's ship and the time elapsed \non Earth. \n \n                   For example, a spaceship could travel to a \nstar 32 light-years away, initially accelerating at a \nconstant 1.03g (i.e. 10.1 m/s2) for 1.32 years (ship time), \nthen stopping its engines and coasting for the next 17.3 \nyears (ship time) at a constant speed, then decelerating \nagain for 1.32 ship-years, and coming to a stop at the \ndestination. After a short visit the astronaut could return \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

After the full round-trip, the \nclocks on board the ship show that 40 years have passed, \nbut according to those on Earth, the ship comes back 76 \nyears after launch. \n \n                 From the viewpoint of the astronaut, on-\nboard clocks seem to be running normally. The star \nahead seems to be approaching at a speed of 0.87 light \nyears per ship-year. The universe would appear \ncontracted along the direction of travel to half the size it \nhad when the ship was at rest; the distance between that \nstar and the Sun would seem to be 16 light years as \nmeasured by the astronaut. \n \n                   At higher speeds, the time on board will run \neven slower, so the astronaut could travel to the center \nof the Milky Way (30,000 light years from Earth) and \nback in 40 years ship-time. But the speed according to \nEarth clocks will always be less than 1 light year per \nEarth year, so, when back home, the astronaut will find \nthat more than 60 thousand years will have passed on \nEarth.",
    "6. Constant Acceleration \n              Regardless of how it is achieved, a propulsion \nsystem that could produce acceleration continuously \nfrom departure to arrival would be the fastest method of \ntravel. A constant acceleration journey is one where the \npropulsion system accelerates the ship at a constant rate \nfor the first half of the journey, and then decelerates for \nthe second half, so that it arrives at the destination \nstationary relative to where it began. If this were \nperformed with an acceleration similar to that \nexperienced at the Earth's surface, it would have the \nadded advantage of producing artificial \"gravity\" for the \ncrew. Supplying the energy required, however, would \nbe prohibitively expensive with current technology. \n \n              From the perspective of a planetary observer, \nthe ship will appear to accelerate steadily at first, but \nthen more gradually as it approaches the speed of light \n(which it cannot exceed). It will undergo hyperbolic \nmotion. The ship will be close to the speed of light after \nabout a year of accelerating and remain at that speed \nuntil it brakes for the end of the journey. \n \n              From the perspective of an onboard observer, \nthe crew will feel a gravitational field opposite the \nengine's acceleration, and the universe ahead will appear \nto fall in that field, undergoing hyperbolic motion. As \npart of this, distances between objects in the direction of \nthe ship's motion will gradually contract until the ship \nbegins to decelerate, at which time an onboard \nobserver's experience of the gravitational field will be \nreversed. \n \nWhen the ship reaches its destination, if it were to \nexchange a message with its origin planet, it would find \nthat less time had elapsed on board than had elapsed for \nthe planetary observer, due to time dilation and length \ncontraction. \n \nThe result is an impressively fast journey for the crew.",
    "7. Results  \nUsing this concept of a BH Powered Starship which \ncan travel at a substantial Speed of Light, we can go \nthrough the Interstellar space, explore the stars and may \nfind Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence in deep space.",
    "8. Discussion  \n        Everything that has been proposed for future must \nbe made conceivable in the event that we can build up \nour \npresent \npropulsion, \nspacecraft \ndesign \nand \ncommunication framework. If done, we can travel \nthrough the profound interstellar space and return earth \nfor crew exchange and give the information reports of \nour missions.",
    "9.

Hibernation Pods and techniques \nSpace trips to different areas of space would require \na very long time to go through the vacuum of space. \nMaintaining the health of astronaut and the crew \nmembers is a major concern.  If the crew could be \ninduced to hibernate, the issues of survival end up \nplainly less demanding to settle. \n \nHibernation is a kind of torpor, or reduced \nmetabolism caused by hypothermia. \"Therapeutic \nhypothermia'' is a well-established procedure used \nin hospitals throughout the world. It is performed \non a large number of patients to treat heart failure \nor traumatic brain injury. It adds up to gradually \ncooling the body to 32-34 C, typically one degree \nfor every hour, which slows down the heart rate and \ndecreases the blood pressure to give doctors more \ntime  to  treat  acute  heart  and  mind  issues.  The \npatient remains in stasis for 2-4 days, however there \nhave  been  examples  where  specialists kept  their \npatient in this state for up to two weeks. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6: Hibernating Pods \n \nHibernation solves a variety of problems connected \nto deep-space travel: \nDormant astronauts would be immobilized in \nspecial hibernation capsules, and would not need \npressurized living space or artificially generated \ngravity. \nIn their coma-like state, the astronauts would be \nmonitored automatically by the spaceship’s \ncomputer, and fed intravenously. \nRadiation is a prime concern in deep-space travel. \nHeavy radiation shielding could be provided only to \nthe crew’s sleep capsules instead of the ship’s large \nliving areas, saving a lot of weight and fuel. \nUnconscious astronauts would not have to remain \nmentally active in order maintain their sanity on the \nlong voyage \nPersonal stasis pods have some advantages- You \ncan \ncontrol \neveryone’s \nambient \ntemperature \nindividually. They also come in handy in case of \nbreakdown or an emergency like pathogen. That’s \nwhy Spaceworks’ engineers are leaning toward an \nopen, shared stasis chamber. There would be some \nrobotic arms and monitoring systems taking care of \nthe  people  and  small  transnasal  tubes  for  the \ncooling  and  some  warming  systems  as  well,  to \nbring them back from stasis. \nEinstein’s relativity makes that perfectly possible. \nLet’s take Alpha Centauri, a little more than 4.3 \nlight  years  away  from  us.  If  only  we  could \naccelerate a spaceship to, say, 0.8 the speed of light, \nthe time dilation would really kick in. The journey \nwould last more than five years, as measured by \nclocks on Earth, but only few months, as measured \nby clocks onboard the spaceship. And the journey \nwill get shorter for the crew, the closer they get to \nthe speed of light. A few months of flight is all the \nfuture astronauts will need.",

Ever since the dawn of \ncivilisation, mankind has been searching for sources of energy far and wide. Man learning to light a fire was \nthe most elementary step in this process. Eventually, in due course of time, man started to learn about new \nways to harness energy in an efficient manner. Archimedes came along, and hence civilizations learnt how to \nconvert one form of energy to the other. During the Industrial revolution, Steam engines became the next big \nthing. Lifestyle of the people also increased, and hence their energy requirements. The sun, in this regard, \nseems to be the obvious choice. Solar energy, so far seems to be the best option as far as both abundance and \neffectiveness are taken into account. When it comes to renewable energy, only the Sun is capable of fulfilling \nour appetite for energy. It is high time we start thinking of next level alternatives. Harvesting the energy of \nthe sun is the next major breakthrough for humankind. The most interesting answer to this question, perhaps \nthe most creative, and one with infinite possibilities is the Dyson Sphere. The mother star (in our case, the \nsun) holds enormous energy reservoirs to meet future demand and supply gaps. A Dyson sphere aims to \nposition itself in such a manner around the sun that all the radiations are contained around it. The radiation \nhence collected is converted to electricity and passed on to smaller satellites to create a systematic distribution \nnetwork. An important point to note here is that, due to the sheer amount of energy available, the array of \napplications possible is infinite. Right from feeding the existing channels of energy, Dyson spheres will open \na plethora of opportunities for fields that have huge amounts of energy requirement. An energy substitute for \nall energy sources, and can be used for everything right from space defence systems to wireless charging of \ndevices, the Dyson Sphere system can be used like a telecommunication network transmitting off radiations to \nmeet energy requirements. This paper will be discussing about the ways how we can eventually be able to \ntransmit the absorbed energy from sun to Earth for the betterment of human future. \nKeywords : Dyson, hypothetical, energy, shells, transmission, Kardashev scale, inevitable, alternative \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

    "1. Introduction",
    "1.1 What is a Dyson Sphere? \nA Dyson Sphere may be best defined as a \nhypothetical shell an advanced civilization \ncould build around a star to capture it’s energy \nand transmit it back to the mother planet (in \nour case, the earth), for generation of energy. \n \nBack in 1960, physicist Freeman Dyson came \nup with the path-breaking and unconventional \nidea of using a Dyson Sphere to fulfil the \nenergy needs of the civilization. \n \nVast megastructures built around entire stars \ncapable of harvesting enough energy to meet \nthe needs of an entire civilisation sounds like \njust the thing to lift our civilisation to the next \nlevel. Astrophysicist Freeman Dyson, in his \npaper titled “Search for artificial stellar sources \nof Infrared Radiation” proposed that an \nadvanced civilisation would have such massive \namounts of energy requirements that they \nwould have to build artificial habitats around \nthe parent star in the form of vast shells, \ncapable of transmitting all the energy of the \nstar. And successfully harvesting the energy of \na star will put a civilisation at Type-2 on the \nKardashev Scale, at which we’re currently at \ntype 0. \n \n10^26 Watts of power sounds lucrative, but the \nquestion is, are Dyson spheres the way to go? \nTwo basic questions arise:",
    "1. Are Dyson spheres Plausible?",
    "2. Are Dyson Spheres inevitable? \nIf mankind could successfully pull this off, \nit’d have about 500 million times more surface \narea than Earth and generate about 10^26 \nWatts of energy. \n \nThe plausibility of a solid sphere of such \nhumongous size may be contested. But on the \nother hand, it’s inevitability is out of the \nquestion.",
    "1.2 The need for a Dyson Sphere: \n \nA civilisation can primarily and broadly be \njudged based on the amount of energy it \nconsumes. Rapid growth of mankind has given \nrise to exorbitantly increasing rates of energy \nrequirement for the planet. Growth and \nsustenance of the power sector is the \nprerequisite of any civilisation. As of 2015, the \nevaluated demand of power supply in India \nalone by 2030 was 960 GW*. \nThe major resource used for generation of this \npower would be coal and petroleum, which \ngreatly increases the emissions in the planet’s \natmosphere. \nSolar Energy or the energy of any other star \npresents itself as the cleanest form of energy \nthere possibly can be. It is abundantly clear \nthat the resources of this planet won’t last \nforever. Future generations need to be \nresourceful if they are to power their world. \n \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \nIAC17,D4,1,11,x41332 \n \n \n \nA Dyson Sphere presents itself as the greatest \npossible discovery in the destiny of mankind, \nthe turning point towards a superior and \nprogressive civilisation. \nThe idea is to create a sphere around the \nmother star in such a way that it encloses most \nof the radiation emitting out of it. The collected \nenergy would then be transmitted through \ndedicated satellites to further substations, \nwhere the radiation would be processed into an \nappropriate form of energy depending on the \ntype of use. \nImagine, the extent of possibilities a near \nunlimited reservoir of energy has up for offer. \nThe energy hence processed could be put to \nvariety of applications ranging from wireless \ncharging of mobile phones to powering entire \nindustries and residences. A bigger, more \nconcentrated and dense beam of radiations may \nalso be used as a weapon, though that may be \ncontroversial since the Dyson Sphere should \nmainly be used for generation of clean and \nabundant energy. \n \nThe surface of the Dyson Sphere, if such a \nsphere is feasible can also be home to the \ncivilisation \nas \nthe \nsurface \narea \nwould \napproximately be 500 million times more than \nthat of Earth. Hence, the sphere would also \nprovide an alternate habitat for the civilisation \nto dwell in. \n \nAs for the 2 questions in consideration, as \nmentioned earlier, Dyson Sphere seems to be \ninevitable. But what about plausibility? Are \nsuch huge spheres around the sun actually \npossible? Let us examine the drawbacks of \nsuch a spherical shell:",
    "1. The massive amounts of raw material is \nthe biggest drawback for a Dyson Sphere. \nTo build a sphere around the sun with a \nsurface area about 500 times more than \nthat of the Earth sounds untenable, and \nwill possibly require dismantling of entire \nplanets for it to build.",
    "2. From an engineering point of view, a \nDyson \nSphere \ndoes \nsound \npretty \noutrageous. The surface of the sun is not \nexactly regular, so anomalies in gravity \nmay lead to a certain part of the Sphere \ncollapsing into the star. The sphere would \nessentially be floating in free space, so \nkeeping it in place would turn out to be \nproblem.",
    "3. The tensile strength needed to prevent the \nsphere from tearing itself apart hugely \nexceeds that of any known material.",
    "2.1 Science behind the sphere  \n \n \nAn interesting question that now comes up is the \nposition of the Dyson Sphere. What would be the ideal \nposition to place the sphere in space? \n \nThe most important purpose of a Dyson Sphere would \nbe to collect and transmit energy. Naturally, a position \nfrom where the sphere can collect the maximum energy \nis desirable. The point of heliopause seems to be ideal to \nsatisfy such a criterion. The heliopause is located at \nabout a distance of 123 AU from the Sun. At such a \nlarge radius, all of the Sun’s energy is accessible and \nevery last bit of it can be absorbed. Thus, this seems to \nbe the ideal point for the location of the sphere. \n \nOn the contrary, a 123AU would have a significant \ndelay in energy collection per unit time. \n \nIn which case, 1 AU might be the most efficient \ndistance for energy collection owing to sustainability. \n Every day, the Earth receives about 175 quadrillion \nwatts of energy from the Sun, which is roughly 4 times \nthe current peak consumption. \n \nNow this is a truly massive amount of energy, which \nprobably gives rise to another question: Wouldn’t a \nDyson Sphere heat up? \n \nEven if the civilisation using the Dyson Sphere did its \nbest, thermodynamics would eventually win and the \nsphere would radiate heat till the point equilibrium is \nestablished. \nThe temperature is given by: \n \nT=[E/(4 pi eta sigma r^2)]^(1/4) \n \nwhere eta is the emissivity (=1 for a blackbody), sigma \nthe constant of Stefan-Boltzman's law (5.67032e-8 \nWm^2K^-4) and E is the total energy output of the star. \n \nAt 1 AU, the energy flux is around 1.4e3 W/m^2, which \ncalculates as around 395 K, or 122 degrees C if the \nsphere is a blackbody. This is a bit too hot for an earth \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \nIAC17,D4,1,11,x41332 \n \n \n \nlike biosphere. The Earth is cooled down by its rotation, \nso perhaps a Dyson Sphere may need to revolve around \nits axis too, to cool down.",
    "2.1 The Alternative: \n \nHence major questions arise of the plausibility \nof such a mega structure around the sun. \nConsidering the limitations of a Dyson Sphere \n(Dyson himself doubted the feasibility of an \nactual sphere around the sun), it is only \nappropriate to look for structural ramifications \nto make the idea possible. One such idea is to \nbuild a ring around the mother star. That would \nrequire less resources and since it would be \nnear to the equator, gravitational anomalies \ncould be reduced to a great extent. \nThe following alternatives may be best suited \nto be modifications of a Dyson Sphere while \nwithstanding the test of both plausibility and \ninevitability:",
    "1. The White Dwarf alternative: \n \nİbrahim Semiz and Salim Oğur (Boğaziçi \nUniversity, Istanbul) have been speculated \nto be working out the plausibility of a \nDyson Sphere not built around a G-class \nstar like the sun, but a white dwarf. \nMoreover, the sheer number of white \ndwarfs \navailable \nwould \nmake \nit \na \nfascinating prospect, considering how \nevery star with mass less than 4 times of \nthat the sun is almost guaranteed to \nbecome a white dwarf. \n \nIncidentally, white dwarfs also seem to be \nbetter hosts for a Dyson Sphere than the \nsun, because the habitable zone is much \ncloser to the star and also the smaller size \nwould consequently give rise to higher \ngravity. \nAlso, since the energy stored in a white \ndwarf is less than a sun, the Sphere \nprobably would not be luminous, making \nit that harder to detect.",
    "2. The Dyson Swarm \n \nA Dyson Swarm evolves out of the \nconcept \nof \na \nDyson \nSphere. \nThe \nconstraints around the concept of a Dyson \nSphere may put a question mark on the \nplausibility of the structure, but not the \ninevitability of it.   \n \nDyson Swarms are an attempt to make the \nidea of a Dyson Sphere feasible. \n \nInstead of a continuous structure around \nthe sun, individual units of about a \ndiameter of 1000 metres suspended in the \nstable orbits around the sun, would do all \nthe job a Dyson Sphere intended to, minus \nthe constraints involved. Build enough \nsuch units, and the energy of the sun is \nthere for the taking. \n \n \nThe biggest challenge here is that \nhumankind might have to dissemble an \nentire planet for the construction of such a \nswarm. As studied by futurist Stuart \nArmstrong, Mercury might have to be \ncannibalised on to make this happen. \nMercury has a solid and huge solid iron \ncore, comprising of more than 35% of the \nmass.*That and the presence of abundant \noxygen in the crust, haematite can be \ngenerated. Haematite is a highly reflective \niron ore that is very lustrous in nature and \nmay act as an excellent reflector of the \nradiation. Hence the swarm shall be filled \nwith such individual units. These units \nwould then reflect the radiation from the \nsun to a receiver satellite, which would \ndirect the radiation to a power plant for \nconversion of energy in its desirable form.  \n \nAn exciting factor that somewhat tilts the \nscales in the Dyson Swarm’s favour is the \nfact that such little collector units may not \nbe beyond us by a few years. The idea is to \nslowly build collector units and place them \nin stable orbits around the sun. \nThe gravity of Mercury is somewhat low, \nthat may make the process of mining \nsomewhat easier. Energy supply at the \nstart would be the first big challenge. The \nfirst collector would take the most time to \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

But once built, it could start \ngenerating \npower \nin \na \nshort \ntime. \nSubsequently the collectors would be \nplaced in stable orbits around the sun and \ngenerate power for further mining. The \nmining, automation and robotics industry \nhave been progressing at an very fast rate. \nAssembly projects in space are coming \nvery soon. Hence the first of collector \nunits can be built and put into orbit in the \nnext 50 years, and a partial Dyson Swarm \nmay not be that beyond us.",
    "2.2 Further benefits: \n \nAn added benefit of such a Dyson Swarm may \nbe the fact that it could also be used in the \nsearch for the extra-terrestrial. The shell or \nswarm may indeed absorb the light and high \nenergy radiation from the sun, it may still emit \ninfrared radiation which may be detectable. \nThis would be a tell-tale sign of the presence of \neven a partial Dyson swarm, as it would give \nout a light signature. \nThis gives us yet another way to search for ET.",
    "4. Results  \nAny civilisation may jump to level 2 on the \nKardashev Scale by generating energy from renewable \nsources in an efficient manner. So far, solar power \nseems to be the safest bet. With megastructures like a \nDyson Sphere in place, Earth would never be energy \nhungry again. An enormous energy reservoir seems to \nbe an abstract idea as of now, but we are no far away. \nEngineering assembly projects in space have already \nbegun to gather pace and it’s a matter of time before we \nhave to cannibalize another galactic body for resources. \nHaematite can be extracted from Mercury, and it’s \nexcellent reflective properties may be used to unlock a \nnear inexhaustible energy pool. The Dyson Sphere will \nbe the next big milestone in the chronicle of humankind. \nAnd it is inevitable. We just have to find the right idea \nto make it plausible as well.",
    "5. Discussion  \nAn argument may be made that owing to the \nlimitations of such a gigantic structure around the Sun, \ncombined with technical difficulties in achieving it, a \nDyson Swarm may be the ideal path to step on. But one \nthing is for sure, any model that may be suitable for \nsuch huge amounts of energy creation may inevitably \nstem out and evolve from the basic idea and principles \nof a Dyson Sphere.",
    "6. Conclusions  \nMankind is energy hungry. The more we get, the \nless it becomes. Conventional sources of energy are \nravaging our home. It is high time we looked to a more \nnature friendly alternative, but at the same time, \nsupremely efficient too. It’s time we started looking at \nspace as something for the present rather than the \ndistant future. A project such as the Dyson Sphere in \nspace may prove to be incredibly challenging and \nexorbitantly expensive, but that is the only place to go. \nSurely, if the capitalist economy decides, it could put up \nparts of Dyson Sphere/swarm in the orbit in the next 50 \nyears.  \nWe have the basic know-how of things, and robotics can \nhelp cannibalize Mercury. It’s just a matter of when not \nif. And all signs point to the fact that it will have to be \nsooner rather than later. \n \n \nAcknowledgements  \n \nSincere thanks and regards to Dr.  Ugur Guven, Mr. \nShashank Pathak and all my co-authors without whom \nthis would not be possible. \n \n \nReferences \n  \nList of references  \n \n[1] large.stanford.edu/courses/2016/ph240/wee1/ \n \n[2] https://www.technologyreview.com/s/.../physicists-\ndescribe-new-class-of-dyson-spher... \n \n [3] \nhttps://www.decipherias.com/2017/04/28/dyson-       \nsphere/ \n \n[4] https://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=32788 \n \n[5]  Demand forecasting for installation capacity by \nIndian power sector by Dr. Hiranmoy Roy, Dr. Rajeev \nSharma, Mr. MVS Sai Hemant. \n \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Since \nmankind has looked upon the stars, he has felt the compulsion to reach out there. However, mostly this has remained a dream \nrather than a reality due to limitations in current space technology. When it comes to manned missions, the farthest location \nthat we have been able to reach is the Moon. Going to a nearby planet such as Mars with a manned mission still seems to be \nat least a decade away with the present technology. In addition, transportation of unmanned probes for deep space missions \nalso has not really advanced too much as compared to the technologies of the Voyager missions’ era. Current technology \nallows for decades to pass before it can even be possible to reach heliopause with a new probe. However, regardless of these \nabove conditions, it is essential to explore options for interstellar missions. Consequently, in the present, the dream of stars \ncompels many scientists to work on interstellar missions even though it may not be possible to initiate such a mission with \ncurrent technology. This paper discusses the possibility of an interstellar mission to Epsilon Eridani. Epsilon Eridani is \nchosen is due to the fact that it is at the 10 light years boundary of the near interstellar space around our solar system. This \nstar is at an approximate distance of 10.5 light years with an apparent magnitude of 3.73. It is a young sun with an age less \nthan a billion years and hence harbors a lot of potential for further research. Consequently, it has been a focal point in many \nscience fiction novels and it has been a target for SETI research as well. Thus, Epsilon Eridani presents a good destination \nfor interstellar travel. Hence, this paper will present a case study analysis of interstellar travel to Epsilon Eridani by \ncomparing different modes of propulsion and plotting the distance, time and specific impulse for gas core nuclear propulsion \nsystem which promises to reach in a reasonable amount of time. The challenges of such a mission will be presented in detail \nand the effects of semi relativistic speeds will be considered along with the corresponding mass expansion and time dilation. \nThis paper will present this case study to become a reference point for similar unmanned interstellar missions in the future. \nKeywords: Interstellar Flight, Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Gas Core Propulsion, Nuclear Flight, Interstellar Probe, \nInterstellar Mission \nNomenclature \nIsp = Specific Impulse \nVe= Exhaust velocity \nc= Speed of Light \n \nAcronyms/Abbreviations \nε Eri: Epsilon Eridani \nEridani 18: Epsilon Eridani \nGCR   : Gas Core Nuclear Reactor",
    "1. Introduction \nLe Reve d’Etoiles or the Dream of Stars has been a \ncommon dynamo for mankind since the dawn of the \ncivilization. Even with ancient civilization such as \nBabylonians, Assyrians, Mayans and Egyptians; the stars \nalways represented a means of reaching far into the heavens \nas the twinkling stars represented heavenly light and serious \nastronomical work was done in order to understand the \nmeaning behind the stars [1]. \nToday, we know for a fact that there are billions of \ngalaxies and each galaxy consists of billions of stars. So we \ncan say it’s a never ending loop as more and more stars are \ndiscovered every day. Naturally, especially with the \nadvancements after the second half of the 20th century, it has \nbecome a realistic dream of mankind to visit those stars \nsomeday. While the idea of visiting stars has become a very \ncommon concept for the purview of science fiction; the real \nscience is quite far behind achieving these objectives. \nWithin today’s standards, even achieving a manned flight to \nany destination beyond the destination of Moon is a very \nimportant challenge, since it requires quite advanced \nmission planning that incorporates things such as protection \nfrom radiation exposure on prolonged missions, life support \nrequirements such as food, water and exercise for a long \nyear missions, as well as sufficient power sources with \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Naturally, the objective is to make sure that the \nmission can be concluded within an acceptable time frame \nas every extra day that is added to the mission stage will \ncause severe problems with the above concepts. Thus, as \nfrom above requirements, it can become almost impossible \nto mount a mission that can require several years to \ncomplete. However, if interstellar mission is to be idealized, \nthem the most important component for it is the specific \nimpulse, which will allow for a mission time to be shortened \nas much as possible. Of course, it is also important that the \nacceleration and deceleration components are made in a way \nto suite requirements for such a high speed mission as well \n[2][3]. In general, while these concepts hold true for any \ninterstellar flight, the utmost importance is given to \ndestinations which are within the 10 light-year radius of our \nsolar system. Epsilon Eridani had been chosen as a case \nstudy as it is at the outer far edge of this envelope for \ninterstellar travel.",
    "2.  Star Epsilon Eridani",
    "2.1 Location of Epsilon Eridani \nThe objective of this paper is to focus on a mission to \nEpsilon Eridani, which is approximately 10.5 light years \nfrom the Sun and it is the 13th nearest star to the Earth and \nsecond-closest star system to Earth, known to host a planet. \nIt is located in the southern hemisphere of the constellation \nEridanus. With a stellar classification of K2 V, it is the \nsecond-nearest K-type main-sequence star (after Alpha \nCentauri B) as compared to our sun. Epsilon Eridani is also \nknown as ε Eri, Epsilon Eri, Ran, 18 Eridani. Some of the \ninteresting properties for Epsilon Eridani can be seen below \nincluding the star as well as its system.  \n \nTable 1.

    "10.5 ly, it is one of the closest stars to Earth. It is thought to \nhave a relatively young age of approximately 730 Myr, and \nhas a mass similar to that of our Sun. There is also tentative \nradial velocity evidence for a companion in an a = 3.4 AU \norbit. These factors all combine to make it an attractive \ntarget for a sustained, deep imaging search for an extrasolar \nplanet. \n \nFig. 1. Location of Epsilon Eridani \n \nAs the closest “dusty star”, even the low resolution of \nSCUBA shows a well-defined ring structure with a radius of \n20’’ – 30’’ and apparently several dense regions. The \npresence of this considerable substructure suggests the \npossibility of an unseen agent, most likely a low-mass \ncompanion, shaping the dust [4].",
    "2.3 Planetary System of Epsilon Eridani \nA Jovian planet is suspected to orbit at around 3AU from \nɛ Eri, from radial velocity wobble and Hubble Space \nTelescope/ Hipparcos astrometry, but a consistent planetary \nsolution is elusive and complicated by a possible 7 yr \nmodulation of the stellar activity cycle [5].",
    "2.4 Possibility of Life in the Epsilon Eridani System \n \nThe similarities of ɛ Eri to inferences about the young \nsolar system make it worth assessing prospects for a \nterrestrial planet in the Habitable Zone spanning 0.5–1 AU, \nespecially as we see the system at about a fifth of the Sun’s \ncurrent age. This is roughly when the solar system is thought \nto have undergone shifting of giant planet orbits with radical \nperturbations of the comet and asteroid belts [5].",
    "3. Interstellar Travel Technologies",
    "3.1 Challenges in Interstellar Travel \nConstant acceleration is a proposed aspect of future \nforms of space travel. It entails that the propulsion system \noperates continuously with a steady acceleration, rather than \nthe brief impulsive thrusts used by chemical rockets – for \nhalf of the journey it constantly pushes the spacecraft \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Over interstellar distances a \nspaceship using significant constant acceleration will \napproach the speed of light, so special relativity effects (like \nthe time dilation and mass expansion) become important.  \nA major limiting factor for constant acceleration drives is \nhaving sufficient amount of fuel available. Constant \nacceleration won’t be feasible until the specific impulse for \nfuel has become much higher. A second big issue facing \nships using constant acceleration for interstellar travel is \ncolliding with matter and radiation while on route. In mid-\njourney any matter the ship strikes will be impacting at near \nlight speed, so the impact will be dramatic. \nThere are different technologies which are available for \ninterstellar travel. Standard chemical propulsion techniques \nare not sufficient as the specific impulse obtained by such a \nmethod is very less for the requirements of this mission. \nHence, with existing technologies, nuclear propulsion \nmethods are taken into consideration, but it is quickly seen \nin various papers that standard nuclear thermal reaction is \nnot sufficient for obtaining these specific impulses and as a \nresult, a more advanced form of propulsion called Gas Core \nNuclear Reactor Propulsion system is considered here for \ninterstellar flight to Epsilon Eridani.",
    "3.2 Gas Core Reactors in Rockets \nGaseous core nuclear reactor is quite different from a \nregular nuclear reactor which uses zirconium coated nuclear \nfuel rods containing Uranium 235 pellets. In essence, the \nnuclear fuel is not in a solid state in a gaseous core nuclear \nreactor and it is rather in a gaseous state. Usually, Uranium \nTetrafluoride or Uranium Hexafluoride is used as a gaseous \nfuel for these reactors and naturally fission kinetics will be \nvery different. The reflectors can be the same as solid fueled \nnuclear reactors, but obviously there won’t be an option to \nuse light water or heavy water as a moderator.  The overall \nheat properties of a gaseous core nuclear reactor will be \nmuch more than a regular LWPR and thus this makes them \npreferable for high heat missions.  \nThe large temperature gradients which can be achieved \nby GCR is perfect for high specific impulses as more heat in \nthe rocket chamber would mean higher exhaust velocity for \nthe rocket. In the below figure, it is possible to see the \ntypical representation of a gas core reactor in a rocket \nconfiguration. Uranium Hexafluoride is taken as a nuclear \nfuel and diatomic hydrogen is assumed as propellant in the \nconfiguration below.  \n \n             Fig. 2. Typical Gas Core Reactor Design",

This is as expected \nas the time to accelerate to the velocities given in the tables \nabove are not very large due to high specific impulse \ncharacteristics of GCR in spacecraft.  \nHowever, increasing velocity from 0.4c to 0.8c the time \nduration of mission reduces by 13 years. This is an \nimportant amount of time when a manned mission is \nconsidered as it will allow the life span of humans to travel \nto Epsilon Eridani and then conduct a mission before \nreturning back to Earth via same pathway.

Total Time on Spacecraft with Spacecraft velocity \n \nMoreover, one of the advantages in traveling at \nsuch high speeds is the relativistic effects of the flight. For \nexample, as seen in Table 4 for best case scenario, the flight \nwould take 13.28 years from the perspective of time spent \non   Earth, but from the perspective of spacecraft only 8.03 \nyears would pass. Thus even if a 1 year mission is planned \nfor inside the Epsilon Eridani system, it would be possible to \ncome back to Earth in roughly 17 years. \nNaturally, several challenges would continue to \nexist for this mission. While nuclear fuel would not be a \nproblem for a GCR Rocket, the Hydrogen propellant would \nbe difficult to store and some method to scoop up interstellar \nhydrogen may have to be devised. Of course, also the life \nsupport requirements of the crew inside the spacecraft \nwould necessitate the presence of air, food and water \nsufficient for the duration of the mission. Although, \nrecycling technology can be used heavily, still the amount of \nmaterials for life support will be immense for a 17 year \nmission (from ship’s time perspective), In addition, the \nrequirements for radiation shielding will be very high for a \nGCR rocket as the crew will need to be protected from \nradiation exposure.  \nAs stated above, mankind is looking for a new and \nexotic ways to start an interstellar travel to the nearest stars. \nEven if at the end of the mission, nothing is found, it will at \nleast prove to the mankind that travel to the stars is possible. \nEpsilon Eridani represents the culmination of these dreams \nas mankind can reach even further destinations after such a \nmission. Even though it is not possible to reach such a \ndestination yet with present technology, this paper gives an \noverview of the requirements for such a mission in the \nhopes that it will take its place in the history of spaceflight, \nso that the dream of stars can be realized someday.",

Especially with the growing \nstakeholders in the aerospace sector, it has become more prominent with the involvement of governments, space \nagencies, global aerospace companies as well as with the emergence of new investors. Thus, more and more new \nengineering recruits enter their undergraduate engineering education in hopes of working either for the government \nor for the private sector. However, not all students have access to similar educational outreach programs and this can \ncause different outcomes for the same objectives. The ideal education for undergraduate space engineers of the future \nmust combine several different streams where the students can specialize on their area of interest in their 3rd and 4th \nyear of their undergraduate education. Of course, this specialization must be combined with theoretical courses to \nreinforce the fundamental physics and engineering concepts along with practical knowledge that is required in order \nto become a competent space engineer. The practical knowledge can be a combination of laboratory courses as well \nas co-op programs and internships which can have a profound impact on the student. Naturally, the laboratory \ncourses must be of sufficient credit and they must entail basics of heat transfer, propulsion, aerodynamics and control \ntheory to reinforce the theoretical concepts of the student. The co-op and the internships can be in form of short \nsummer internships as well as in form of long winter training sessions. They must be conducted at aerospace \ngovernment facilities or at prominent aerospace companies in order to benefit the student fully.  Furthermore, the 4 \nyear undergraduate program must be interlaced with workshops, seminars and guest speakers in order to strengthen \nthe solution. Of course, besides the formal 4 year undergraduate education, the student must be supported and \nmotivated to participate in national and international competitions and also motivated to participate in international \nforums such as IAC for maximum exposure to global space community and practices.

This way the student can use the \nprogramming language to solve various numerical \nproblems that may be related to his or her profession \nas a space engineer.  \nThe generalized engineering courses can be given \nseparately or they can be combined with mechanical \nengineering batches as the level of the course will be \nequivalent to that. In addition, some advanced Math \ncourses such as Complex Variables and the Theory of \nDifferential Equations can be given as well.",
    "2.3 Specialized Astronautics Courses in 2nd Year \nNaturally, some basic astronautics and aerospace \ncourses will need to be provided in the second year.

    "4. Importance of Major & Minor Project Selection \nIt should be stated that the major and minor \nproject selections of the student can play a very \nimportant role in the success of the undergraduate \nspace engineering program. It is essential to choose \nprojects which allow for specialization in his or her \narea of interest for best results.  \nOf course, the student must choose his or her \nproject after consultation with their faculty mentors. \nNormally, it would be prudent to suggest that a minor \nproject which is taken in the 3rd year should be on a \npractical topic in an area already learned by the \nstudent. Furthermore, the major project should be \ntaken as an undergraduate thesis project and must be \ncompleted in the 4th year of the undergraduate \nprogram.  \nIt is essential that the 4th year undergraduate thesis \nproject (major project) should be done in the field that \nthe student wishes to specialize in. For example, if the \nstudent wishes to specialize in propulsion methods, \nthen the undergraduate thesis must be on a relevant \ntopic and it must be advanced enough so that the \nundergraduate space engineering student’s skills and \nintellectual acumen can be sufficiently stimulated. \nThe undergraduate thesis must incorporate all the past \nknowledge learned coupled with a new outlook to \nallow the student to investigate new topics. The \nstudent must give a final presentation in front of \nfaculty and peers. The grading must be done based \nupon the originality of the work as well as on the \nquality of the results. \nIn both of the projects, the students can utilize \nexperimentation, simulation using various software \nsuch as ANSYS and COMSOL as well as numerical \nstudy using mathematical techniques and coding. Of \ncourse, in case a working model can be made, that \nwould also be a culmination of the project.",
    "5. Importance of Internship Selection \nInternship also plays a very important role as it is \na channel for the student to practice his or her \nknowledge in a different environment as compared to \nthe university environment. The ideal situation is to \nhave the student do a summer internship for 3 months \nat the end of his or her 3rd academic year. The ideal \nlocation for the internship would be for the student to \njoin an aerospace company and to work for 3 months \nin a company environment so that he or she can learn \nthe needful. \nOf course, it may not always be possible for the \nstudent to do his or her internship in an industrial \nenvironment. This may especially be the case for \nstudents who are looking for higher academic studies \n68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Adelaide, Australia, 25-29 September 2017.  \nCopyright ©2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

In addition, it is \nalso possible for the students to conduct their \ninternships at other universities in order to get \nexposed to students and methodology of other \nuniversities with similar programs.  \nOverall, it must be stated that a successful \ninternship \nwill \nbe \nan \nintegral \npart \nof \nthe \nundergraduate space engineering program. There are \nmany past experiences to suggest that some of these \nstudents may even be employed at the same \norganization where they have conducted their \ninternship. \nFurthermore, it is essential to have a qualitative \nreview and grading of the internship. If the internship \nhas bene done in a company or an organization, it is \nessential that an internship evaluation form to be \nfilled and a feedback given to the student.

Exploration of Mars has been the major driving force and \ndestination, of space exploration for past few decades. Reaching to Mars has been a challenge in itself, let alone the \ndevelopment of a system to explore its surface. Although Curiosity and Opportunity have been on Mars for more \nthan a combined 6000 sols, not much of the surface has been mapped. Many orbiters have also been placed into \nMars’s orbit, but the prospect of mapping the Martian surface through rovers, provides more accurate data about the \nmineralogy of the soil, however, robotic exploration is a slower process when compared to aerial surveillance.

The mission \narchitecture proposed through the paper has been designed to maximize the scientific data from the Martian surface. \nVarious trade studies will be included at the architectural and system levels to demonstrate the compliance of the \nscience instruments for a complete optimization. A detailed description of the scientific approach to establishing \ncommunication among the drones will be included.

Comprehensive tables and graphs will be given to illustrate the \ncompliance of the functionality of the constellation of drone, in the harsh environment of Mars. Tables will also be \ngiven to depict the amount of time that will pass at each mode of travel and more importantly, some idea on the cost \nin terms of energy, as well as money, will be discussed within today’s context. Even though the possibility of such a \nmission is probably non-existent for this decade, it is essential to do these exercises so that mankind’s understanding \nof Mars will be increased.

    "1. Introduction \nOther than the Moon, Mars has held a special \nposition in human fascination. Although it is not the \nclosest planet to Earth, it closely resembles the Earth \nand excites our imagination, to explore its planetary \nsurface to increase our understanding of its environment \nand mineralogy. 17 orbiters have successfully been \nplaced in an orbit and 7 rovers have landed on the \nsurface of Mars to provide a better understanding of the \nminerology and also to conduct science experiments on \nits surface. The efforts to increase the understanding of \nMartian surface, for a possibility of human colonies on \nMars, keeps on increasing with each passing year. \n69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Bremen, Germany, 1-5 October 2018.                                  \nIAC-18                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 2 of 5 \n \nThis paper presents an architecture of a futuristic \nmission to Mars.

The data \nobtained could be relayed to Earth and the Mineral map \nalong with surface map could be obtained.  \nEach Martian day, brings along the challenge of \npower requirement, extreme temperature conditions and \nthe possibility of Dust storm. By using a constellation of \ndrones, the number of Martian days required to map the \ncomplete surface of Mars, would be reduced by a huge \nmargin.

    "3.1 Drones Structure and Calculation \n \nFor figuring out the performance of the current \nMother-Daughter drone configuration, environment of \nMars was simulated and the thrust was calculated using \nthe software module CFX provided in the package \nANSYS 18.1. Numerical Simulations for the flow over \nthe propellers was done for which various parameters \nwere needed to be inculcated in the rotating fluid \nsimulation \nof \nthe \npropeller. \nSubsequently, \nthe \nappropriate span of the propeller blade was found out \nwhich created enough lift to give flight to the mother \ndrone along with its daughter units. The Suitable wing \nspan was then figured out to be 1.8 metres which could \ngenerate sufficient thrust for the designed configuration \nof drones. \nThe constant parameter values of Mars’ environment \nwhich were inculcated in numerical simulations were \ntaken from operating condition of Mars condition.

    "3.2 Power and Energy requirement \n \nConsidering the flight time of the mother drone to be \n2 to 3 minutes the battery capacity is estimated \nconsidering the charging time required. Just like on \nEarth, the length of daylight on Mars changes with the \nseasons. So, an estimate that the sun is visible of 9 hours \na day is done. Solar Irradiance, defined as power per \nunit area that is the light reaching the surface of the \nplanet. Max solar irradiance on earth is about 1000 \nwatts per meter square. The value of Maximum solar \nirradiance on MARS is about 590\n.

    "6. Conclusions  \nLately, mankind’s belief is getting more inclined \ntowards being settlers. But primarily in the Palaeolithic \nAge, humans were hunter-gatherers. They were \nexplorers, always looking for food and took shelter in \nplaces such as caves. It is about time we revitalize those \nexploring instincts and be nomadic again but this time \non an interstellar level. In the flow of such thought, \nmars \nexploration \nstratagem \nhere \nis \nconcluded. \nPreviously \nused \nmachine \nlearning \nalgorithm \nis \ndeliberated and feasibility of the algorithm is reviewed \nalong with references provided for the original \nalgorithm source. Upon the application of AI, it is \nconcluded that AI needs to be trained a lot to learn to \nanticipate the need to charge the drones by scrutinizing \nthe battery parameters and outer environmental \nconditions. Also. The time required to charge the drone \nis also needed to be economically managed by the AI \nwith the aid of intuitional algorithms including these \nparameters. And hence, Artificial Intelligence and \nMachine Learning needs to integrated together and \nwork hand in hand because separately learning from \nparametric features is not self-sufficient to survive the \nharsh conditions on Mars. The current stratagem hopes \nto build another simplified step in the greater complex \nstairway towards the Planet Mars. The dinosaurs \nbecame extinct because they didn't have a space \nprogram but we do and it is the duty of mankind to keep \nexploring the space to evade extinction. The paper \nconcludes the foundation of using Machine Learning \nand Artificial Intelligence as an advancement with \nMother-daughter drone Configuration for Martial terrain \nmapping and exploration. \n \nAcknowledgements  \nWe would like to thank University of Petroleum and \nEnergy Studies for their unwavering support.  \n \nReferences \nReference to a journal publication:  \n[1] Orosei, R., Lauro, S.

They reason that if life evolved on Earth, \nthen it could have evolved elsewhere. If, as the argument goes, there are endless planets throughout the universe that \nhave formed via natural procedures, there must be other Earth-like planets. Many think that finding such a planet \noutside our solar system would be relatively similar to finding evidence of life in space. Humans need to answer two \nmain questions regarding exoplanets. 1) Do they exist? and 2) How did they form? The second question has to do \nwith starting point science, but the first has to do with experimental evidence. Scripture does not tell us whether other \nstars have planets, so we must apply the best observational science we can to answer the question. Scientists have \nsearched for years for planets orbiting other stars. These are called extrasolar planets, or ‘exoplanets’. Astronomers \nfirst obtained evidence suggesting extrasolar planets around 1995 while studying the sunsized star 51-Pegasi. Today \nthere are research teams around the world searching for extrasolar planets with greatly refined research techniques. \nThere are now over 450 objects catalogued in exoplanet lists. But all these experiments are done in the plane of our \nsolar system where aberrations are experienced due to the celestial bodies inside our solar system including the large \nKuiper belt. Even the Hubble Space Telescope is situated in the plane of our planetary system. Also, exoplanet \nimaging techniques such as radial velocity method, transit photometry and direct imaging is less efficient while \nobserving the line of sights horizontal and parallel to our solar system disc. The planes of solar systems in the \nuniverse are all oriented in different directions. What determines their orientations is the direction of the angular \nmomentum that the system had when it formed, and that’s pretty much random. Our own solar system is inclined by \nabout 63 degrees with respect to the plane of the milky way galaxy. Experimenting for extra solar planets from \noutside the plane of our solar system will provide best results and allow images to be taken even in the directions not \nexplored before. This paper will focus on the merits and de-merits of performing Exoplanet experiments and imaging \noutside the plane of our solar system. Also, this paper will discuss possible locations and exit paths for our solar \nsystem for future space missions. \nKeywords: (maximum 6 keywords) \n \nNomenclature \nThis section is not numbered.

Though \nother approaches hold great promise for the future, the \nvast majority of Exoplanets discovered so far were \ndetected by this method. \n \n \nFigure 3 Wobbling of the star with respect to \nObserver \n \nThe radial velocity method relies on the fact that a \nstar does not remain completely stationary when it is \norbited by a planet. It moves, ever so slightly, in a small \ncircle or ellipse, responding to the gravitational tug of \nits smaller companion. When viewed from a distance, \nthese slight movements affect the star's normal light \nspectrum, or color signature. If the star is moving \ntowards the observer, then its spectrum would appear \nslightly shifted towards the blue; if it is moving away, it \nwill be shifted towards the red. \nUsing highly sensitive spectrographs, planet hunters \non Earth can track a star's spectrum, searching for \nperiodic shifts towards the red, blue, and back again. \nThe spectrum appears first slightly blue-shifted, and \nthen slightly red-shifted. If the shifts are regular, \nrepeating themselves at fixed intervals of days, months, \nor even years, it means that the star is moving ever so \nslightly back and forth - towards the Earth and then \naway from it in a regular cycle. This, in turn, is almost \ncertainly caused by a body orbiting the star, and if it is \nof a low enough mass it is called a planet. \n \nIt is a fundamental feature of the radial velocity \nmethod that it cannot accurately determine the mass of a \ndistant planet, but only provide an estimate of its \nminimum mass. This is a serious problem for planet-\nhunters, because mass is the leading criterion for \ndistinguishing between planets and small stars. Some \nastronomers believe that at least some of the \"planets\" \ndetected by spectroscopy are not planets at all but very \nlow-mass stars. \nThe source of this trouble with radial velocity is that \nthe method can only detect the movement of a star \ntowards or away from the Earth. This is not a problem if \nthe orbital plane of the distant planetary system appears \n\"edge-on\" when observed from the Earth. In that case, \nthe entire movement of the star will be towards or away \nfrom the Earth, and can be detected with a sensitive \nspectrograph. The mass of the planet, derived from this \nmovement, will in this case be fully accurate. \nIf, however, the orbital plane of the planet is \"face \non\" when observed from the Earth, the entire wobble of \nthe star will be perpendicular to an observer's line of \nvision. While the star may move significantly within the \norbital plane, no part of its movement will be towards or \naway from the Earth. No spectrum shift will be \ndetected, and the Earth-bound observer will remain \nignorant of the presence of a planet orbiting the star. \n \nIn most cases a distant planet's orbital plane is \nneither \"edge-on\" nor \"face-on\" when observed from the \nEarth. Most likely it is tilted at some angle to the line of \nsight, which is usually unknown. This means that a \nspectrograph would not detect the full movement of the \nstar, but only that component of its wobble that moves it \ntowards the Earth or away from it. Now the mass of the \nsuspected planet is directly proportionate to the star's \nactual wobble. If -- as is usually the case -- only a \nportion of this wobble is detected, then the measured \nmass will be lower than the true one and provide only a \nminimum figure for the planet's mass. \nProvide sufficient detail to allow the work to be \nreproduced. Methods already published should be \nindicated by a reference: only relevant modifications \nshould be described. \n \nTransit Photometry \nThis method detects distant planets by measuring the \nminute dimming of a star as an orbiting planet passes \nbetween it and the Earth. The passage of a planet \nbetween a star and the Earth is called a \"transit.\" If such \na dimming is detected at regular intervals and lasts a \nfixed length of time, then it is very probable that a \nplanet is orbiting the star and passing in front of it once \nevery orbital period. \n \n69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Bremen, Germany, 1-5 October 2018.  \nCopyright ©2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \n IAC-18,A4,IP,7,x46141 \n                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 4 of 5 \n \nFigure 4 UnderstandingTransit Photometry \n \nThe dimming of a star during transit directly reflects \nthe size ratio between the star and the planet: A small \nplanet transiting a large star will create only a slight \ndimming, while a large planet transiting a small star will \nhave a more noticeable effect. The size of the host star \ncan be known with considerable accuracy from its \nspectrum, and photometry therefore gives astronomers a \ngood estimate of the orbiting planet's size, but not its \nmass. This makes photometry an excellent complement \nto the spectroscopic method, which provides an estimate \nof a planet's mass, but not its size. Using both methods, \ncombining mass and size, scientists can calculate the \nplanet's density, an important step towards assessing its \ncomposition. \n \nThe main difficulty with this method is that in order \nfor the photometric effect to be measured, a transit must \noccur. This means that the distant planet must pass \ndirectly between its star and the Earth. Unfortunately, \nfor most extra solar planets this simply never happens. \nIn order for a transit to occur the orbital plane must be \nalmost exactly \"edge-on\" to the observer, and this is true \nonly of a small minority of distant planets.  \nIn order to overcome this, the probe launched may \nadjust its trajectory according to the orbital inclination \nof the target planetary system and get to better field of \nview during the transit.  \n \nAnother problem is that a planet's transit lasts only a \ntiny fraction of its total orbital period. A planet might \ntake months or years to complete its orbit, but the transit \nwould probably last only hours or days when viewed \nfrom Earth. As a result, even when astronomers observe \na star with a transiting planet, they are extremely \nunlikely to observe a transit in progress. The problem is \nfurther compounded because in order to establish the \npresence of a planet, astronomers need to observe not \none, but repeated transits occurring at regular intervals. \n \nTo overcome this, the Probe may sync its movement \nwith the movement of the target planets and \ncontinuously observe data from the transit.  \nIn order to find transiting planets at the moment of \ntransit, searches must continuously cover vast stretches \nof sky containing many stars for long periods of time. It \nis highly probable that at least some of the stars \nobserved will have planets, and that at least some of \nthese planets will pass between their star and the Earth. \nObserving the same batch of stars for long stretches of \ntime also makes it far more likely that if a planet does \ntransit its star, the event will be observed and recorded. \nOnly an automated telescope hovering at different \npositions in space away from the orbital plane that \nrecords its observations over long stretches of time can \neffectively detect planets using this method. \n \nDirect Imaging \nDirect imaging of exoplanets is extremely difficult, and \nin most cases impossible. Being small and dim planets \nare easily lost in the brilliant glare of the giant stars they \norbit. Nevertheless, even with existing telescope \ntechnology there are special circumstances in which a \nplanet can be directly observed. \n \n \nFigure 5 A Directly Imaged Planetery System \n \nFomalhaut b was a planet imaged in visible light. \nUnlike this, some planets are detected in the infrared \nrange of the spectrum. This is because it is a young star \nand the planets around it still retain some of the heat of \ntheir formation, which registers in the infrared range. \nFurthermore, whereas in the visible range the reflected \nlight from the planets would be swallowed up by the \nbrilliance of the star, the independent heat of the planets \nstands out far more clearly in the infrared range. \nWith current observation technology direct imaging \nis possible on very rare occasions. It is most likely to \nsucceed when conditions are just right, namely when a \nbright planet orbits at a great distance from a nearby \nstar. To locate these planet configurations and to \nachieve these viewpoints in space at ease, one needs to \ngo beyond the limits of the solar system plane and \nobserve the planetary systems from all possible angles. \n69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Bremen, Germany, 1-5 October 2018.  \nCopyright ©2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Earth has been home to humankind since its birth but now humanity has managed to \ntame Earth and the next step is to traverse into the reaches of the solar system. Although Earth will or will not always \nbe the home to humanity but there are other possible homes for us in this galaxy through colonization. Colonizing \nspace is the next step for humanity that will cause significant advancement benefitting civilization as a whole. \nColonization in space will require a wide variety of equipment—equipment to directly provide services to humans; \nand production equipment used to produce food, propellant, water, breathable oxygen and Energy in order to support \nhuman colonization efforts.  The first thing that is necessary for space colonization to occur is plentiful resources that \nare capable of being exploited at low costs similar to past colonization efforts on Earth. One of these plentiful \nresources in space is the Asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars.  Asteroids are of three types- C-Type, S-Type and \nM-Type; containing large quantities of carbonaceous objects, silicaceous objects and metallic objects, respectively. \nWith the objective for individuals to colonize on different planets or even colonize in space itself, this paper will give \nan adequately solid and self-sustained approach to produce electricity in space using the continuous orbiting of the \nasteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars.  Concentrating on the Energy Production part of Space colonization of \nhumankind later on, this paper will propose a technique to create power consistently in space for future colonization. \nAlso, this paper will throw light on the future aspects of space based electricity in future space missions and the \nutilization of this strategy in asteroid related missions. \n \nNomenclature \nΦB –Magnetic Flux \nΣ –Surface      \nƐ – EMF, Electro Motive Force \nB – Magnetic Field \nE – Electric Field  \n \nAcronyms/Abbreviations \nNASA –National Aeronautics and Space Administration \nNEA- Near Earth Asteroids \nEMF - Electro Motive Force",
    "1. \nIntroduction \nAlong with the planets and their moons,  there exists a \nrocky world which also revolves around the sun, called \nthe asteroids. They are too small to be called planets and \nthus they are also known as minor planets or planetoids. \nThere are millions of asteroids in the solar system.",
    "1.1 Formation \nAbout 4.6 billion years ago when our solar system was \nformed, \nthere \nwere \nleftover \nmaterials \nin \nthe \nsurroundings and were termed as the asteroids. \n Early on, the birth of Jupiter prevented any planetary \nbodies from forming in between Mars and Jupiter, \ncausing the small objects that were there to collide with \neach other and fragment into the asteroids seen today.",
    "1.2 History \nIn 1801, while  making a star map, Italian priest and \nastronomer Giuseppe Piazzi accidentally discovered the \nfirst and largest asteroid, orbiting between Mars and \nJupiter. Ceres accounts for a quarter of the total mass of \nall the known asteroids in or near the main asteroid belt \nand thus it is classified today as a dwarf planet. During \nthe 19th century, several asteroids were discovered and \nwere classified as planets until William Herschel came \nup with the term \"asteroid\" in 1802. Other scientists \nreferred to the newfound objects as minor planets. Ceres \nshares dual designation as both an asteroid and a dwarf \nplanet. By 1851, 15 new asteroids were discovered. \n69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Bremen, Germany, 1-5 October 2018.  \nCopyright ©2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

    "1.3 Physical Characteristics  \nAsteroids vary in size. They can be as large as Ceres, \nwhich is 940 kilometres (about 583 miles) across or \nsmall as space rock 2015 TC25 which is just 6-foot-\nwide (2 meters ), which was observed when it made a \nclose flyby of Earth in October 2015. \nNearly all asteroids are irregularly shaped, unlike a few \nof the largest ones which are nearly spherical, such as \nCeres. They are often pitted or cratered, like which \nhas a giant crater some 285 miles (460 km) in diameter. \nThe surfaces of most asteroids are thought to be covered \nin dust. \nThe asteroids revolve around the sun in elliptical orbits \nand they rotate as well, sometimes tumbling quite \nerratically. According to the studies, more than 150 \nasteroids are known to have a small companion moon, \nwith some of them having two moons.  \nAsteroids of roughly same size which orbit each other \nalso exists, termed as binary or triple asteroids. \nMany asteroids also have been captured by a planet's \ngravity and become moons like Mars' moons, Phobos \nand Deimos, and most of the outer moons of Jupiter, \nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune. The average temperature \nof the surface of a typical asteroid is minus 100 degrees \nFahrenheit (minus 73 degrees Celsius). Asteroids come \nin a variety of shapes and sizes. Some are solid bodies, \nwhile others are smaller piles of rubble bound together \nby gravity. One, which orbits the sun between Neptune \nand Uranus, comes with its own set of rings. Another \nhas not one but six tails.",
    "1.4 Classification \nAsteroids are spread in three regions of the solar system \nwhile most of them occupy the vast ring between the \norbits of Mars and Jupiter. This main asteroid belt \naccommodates more than 200 asteroids larger than 60 \nmiles (100 km) in diameter. Scientists estimate that this \nbelt also contains about 1.1 million asteroids larger than \n1 km (3,281 feet) in diameter and millions of smaller \nones. Not everything in the main belt is termed as an \nasteroid as Ceres, once thought of only as an asteroid, is \nnow called a dwarf planet. In the past decade, scientists \nhave also identified small rocky objects with tails, \nknown as \"main belt asteroids\".  \nMany asteroids lie outside the main belt. The \nclassifications of asteroids based on their orbits are as \nfollows: \nTrojan asteroids orbit a planet in two special places, \nknown as Lagrange points, where the gravitational pull \nof the sun and the planet are balanced.  \nJupiter Trojans are the most numerous, boasting nearly \nas high a population as the main asteroid belt.

Apollo \nasteroids have Earth-crossing orbits but spend most of \ntheir time outside the planet's path. \n Aten asteroids also cross Earth's orbit but spend most \nof their time inside Earth's orbit.  \nAtira asteroids are near-Earth asteroids whose orbits \nare contained within Earth's orbit.  \n \nAccording to the European Space Agency, \napproximately 10,000 of the known asteroids are found \nout to be NEAs. \nAsteroids fall into three classes based on their \ncomposition:  \nThe C-type or carbonaceous asteroids are greyish in \ncolour and are the most common, including more than \n75 percent of known asteroids. They probably consist of \nclay and stony silicate rocks, and inhabit the main belt's \nouter regions.  \nThe S-type or silicaceous asteroids are greenish to \nreddish in color, account for about 17 percent of known \nasteroids, and dominate the inner asteroid belt. They \nappear to be made of silicate materials and nickel-iron.  \nThe M-type or metallic asteroids are reddish in color, \nmake up most of the rest of the asteroids, and dwell in \nthe middle region of the main belt. They seem to be \nmade up of nickel-iron.  \nThere are many other rare types based on composition \nas well — for instance, V-type asteroids typified by \nVesta have a basaltic, volcanic crust. \n \nWhen a solid piece of debris from an asteroid enters the \natmosphere, various factors such as friction, pressure, \nand chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases \ncause it to heat up and radiate that energy.

    "2. \nTheory  \nThe aim is to propose a technique to create power \nconsistently in space using the continuous orbiting \nasteroids of the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars \nto benefit colonization. This can be achieved by using \nthe concept of Electromagnetic Induction.   \nElectromagnetic or magnetic induction is the \nproduction of an electromotive force (i.e., voltage) \nacross an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic \nfield. Electromagnetic induction was discovered by \nMichael Faraday in 1831and was also discovered \nindependently by Joseph Henry in 1832. In Faraday's \nfirst experimental demonstration (August 29, 1831), he \nwrapped two wires around opposite sides of an iron ring \nor \"torus\" (an arrangement similar to a modern toroidal \ntransformer). \nBased \non \nhis \nunderstanding \nof \nelectromagnets, he expected that, when current started \nto flow in one wire which was connected to the battery, \na sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause \nsome electrical effect on the opposite side. So he \nplugged the other wire into a Galvanometer. During this \nexperiment he saw changes in the galvanometer reading \nthis proved the presence of a transient current which he \ntermed as “wave of electricity” This induction was due \nto the change in magnetic flux (Magnetic flux is a \nmeasurement of the total magnetic field which passes \nthrough a given area)  that occurred when the battery \nwas connected and disconnected. Within two months, \nFaraday \nfound \nseveral \nother \nmanifestations \nof \nelectromagnetic induction. For example, he saw \ntransient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in \nand out of a coil of wires, and he generated a steady \n(DC) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar \nmagnet with a sliding electrical lead (\"Faraday's disk\"). \n \n \nFig. 2. A diagram of Faraday's iron ring apparatus. \nChange in the magnetic flux of the left coil induces a \ncurrent in the right coil. \n\\ \nFaraday's law of induction and Lenz's law \nFaraday's law of induction makes use of the \nmagnetic flux ΦB through a region of space enclosed by \na wire loop. The magnetic flux is defined by a surface \nintegral: \n \nwhere dA is an element of the surface Σ enclosed by \nthe wire loop, B is the magnetic field. The dot product \nB•dA corresponds to an infinitesimal amount of \nmagnetic flux. In more visual terms, the magnetic flux \nthrough the wire loop is proportional to the number of \nmagnetic flux lines that pass through the loop. \nWhen the flux through the surface changes, \nFaraday's law of induction says that the wire loop \nacquires an EMF. The most widespread version of this \nlaw states that the induced electromotive force in any \nclosed circuit is equal to the rate of change of the \nmagnetic flux enclosed by the circuit:  \n \nWhere Ɛ is the EMF and ΦB is the magnetic flux. \nThe direction of the electromotive force is given by \nLenz's law which states that an induced current will \nflow in the direction that will oppose the change which \nproduced it.[18] This is due to the negative sign in the \nprevious equation. To increase the generated EMF, a \ncommon approach is to exploit flux linkage by creating \na tightly wound coil of wire, composed of N identical \nturns, each with the same magnetic flux going through \nthem. The resulting EMF is then N times that of one \nsingle wire.  \n \nGenerating an EMF through a variation of the \nmagnetic flux through the surface of a wire loop can be \nachieved in several ways:",
    "1. \nthe magnetic field B changes (e.g. an \nalternating magnetic field, or moving a wire loop \ntowards a bar magnet where the B field is stronger),",
    "2. \nthe wire loop is deformed and the surface Σ \nchanges,",
    "3. \nthe orientation of the surface dA changes (e.g. \nspinning a wire loop into a fixed magnetic field),",

    "3. Methodology \nThis paper proposes a technique that can be used to \ngenerate electricity from the moving metallic asteroids \nin the asteroid belt. This can be achieved by using the \nphenomena of electromagnetic induction. Faraday’s first \nexperiment is itself the solution to this problem. Instead \nof an iron ring, the metallic asteroid belt acts as a \nconducting media and if a wire is wound at one of its \nsides and connected to a battery this primary winding \nwill start conducting electricity. This primary winding, \nwith electricity flowing through it starts behaving like a \nsolenoid. \nAlso it is known that the speed of asteroids in the \nasteroid belt totally depends on their distance from the \nsun. A large portion of known asteroids orbit in a region \nbetween Mars and Jupiter and thus due to their distance \nfrom the sun, their average orbital velocities range \nbetween 17 and 25 km/s  (38,029 to 55,925 mph). \n So when these fast moving metallic asteroids will pass \nthrough the solenoid, a change in magnetic flux will be \nobserved.  \nNow, if similar to the faradays experiment a secondary \nwinding of more no. of turns than the primary winding \nis done the current will start flowing through the \nsecondary winding too due to change in magnetic flux \nthrough the ring area. \nThe basics of this power transmission include the \ninductive energy that can be transmitted from a primary \ncoil to the secondary coil through an oscillating \nmagnetic field due to which the DC current supplied by \na power source is changed into high frequency AC \ncurrent. This AC current can be of great help to the \nhuman settlement on mars because the asteroid belt lies \nitself between mars and Jupiter.  \nInstead of mining asteroids and bringing back resources \nto the earth they can be put into use for generating \npower there itself.",

One of the main challenges for \nmars colonization is the Martian dust storms. Dust storm on Mars can originate in a matter of hours and can cover \nthe entire planet within a few days.

Solar heating warms the atmosphere of Mars and causes the air to move, lifting dust off the ground. \nHuge number of dust storms on the planet originates from one impact basin.

The wind so generated picks up the dust \nfrom the basin and emerges as a storm. These dust storms have always been a matter of concern for the probes that \nwere sent to Mars. This paper aims at providing a solution in order to use these dust storms as an advantage. This can \nbe done by using a filter and windmill arrangement. The filter will aim at settling the dust and then this filtered air \nwill pass through the windmill which would further be helpful in producing electricity.

    "1. \nIntroduction \nAs mankind is coming closer to taking its first steps \non the Red Planet, “Mars”, they have discovered a \nmajor problem on its surface called as the “Martian \nDust Storms”. Mars is infamous for intense dust storms, \nwhich covers it with a huge amount of dust that makes it \ndifficult for the astronauts to view the planet with \ntelescopes on Earth.  \nAll Martian dust storms are powered by sunshine i.e \nthe solar heat from the sun warms the Martian \natmosphere and causes the warm air to move upward, \nlifting dust off the ground. The chance for storms is \nincreased when there are immense temperature \nvariations like those seen at the equator during the \nMartian summer. On Mars a dust storm can develop in \nfew hours and envelope the entire planet within a few \ndays. After developing, it can take weeks for a dust \nstorm to completely expend itself. Scientists are still \nconducting studies to determine why these storms are so \ngigantic and last so long. \n \n \nFig. 1. Martian sand storm",
    "1.1 History \nThe Martian dust storms were of great concern when \nprobes were first sent to Mars.  \nIn 1971, Mariner 9 landed on Mars during the biggest \ndust storm ever recorded. Mission controllers waited for \na few weeks for the storm to subside and then carry on \nwith the mission.  \nThe biggest issue faced by the rovers was the lack of \nsunlight without which it faced problem generating \n69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Bremen, Germany, 1-5 October 2018.  \nCopyright ©2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

For \nnow, the storms on Mars are going to continue to \npresent challenges for future human settlements on \nMars. \n \n \n \nFig. 2. A dust storm on Mars in 2008 temporarily cuts \nthe amount of sunlight reaching the solar array on \nNASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit, leaving the \nrover in a vulnerable state.",
    "1.2  Origin \nThe dust storms on Mars mainly originate from from \none impact basin. One such basin is called the Hellas \nBasin (6 km deep and 2000 km across ) which is the \ndeepest impact crater in the solar system. \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3. Hellas Basin dust storm \n \nIt was formed more than three billion years ago \nduring the Late Bombardment Period when a very large \nasteroid hit the surface of Mars. The temperature at the \nbottom of the crater varies from the temperature at its \nsurface i.e the temperature at the bottom is about 10 \ndegrees warmer than on the surface. Since the crater is \ndeeply filled with dust this difference in temperature \nfuels up the wind action which further picks up the dust \nfrom the crater and results into a storm, similar to those \nthat form in deserts on Earth, to larger continent-sized \nstorms. \n      These larger storms sometimes combine to form a \nglobal storms, which cover the entire planet in \natmospheric dust. Once every three Mars years (about 5 \n½ Earth years), on average, normal storms grow into \nthese planet-encircling dust storms. Large global dust \nstorms put enough dust in the air to completely cover \nthe planet and block out the sun, but doing so ultimately \ndooms the storm itself as the sunlight reaching the \nsurface of the planet is what drives these dust storms. \nLarger storms typically only happen during summer \nin Mars’ southern hemisphere. Seasons on Mars are \ncaused by the tilt of the planet, like on Earth. But Mars’ \norbit is less circular than Earth’s; for part of a Martian \nyear, the planet is closer to the sun and therefore \nsignificantly hotter. This warmer time is during the \nsouthern hemisphere’s summer, so radiative heat forces \nare strongest then. Once started, bigger storms can last \nweeks to months. \n \n \n \nFig. 4. Mars without a dust storm on June 2001 (on \nleft) and with a global dust storm on July 2001 (on \nright), as seen by Mars Global Surveyor",
    "1.3 Observations \nIn the year 1976 Viking spacecraft observed that \nduring a global dust storm, the diurnal temperature (the \ntemperature variation between high temperature and a \nlow temperature that occurs during the same day ) \nnarrowed sharply from 50 degree Celsius to about 10 \ndegrees. Also within an hour of the storm’s arrival, the \nwind speed elevated considerably and had increased to \n17 m/s (61 km/h ), with gusts up to 26m/s (94km/h).  \nOn June 26, 2001, the Hubble Space Telescope \nspotted a dust storm developing in Hellas Basin on Mars. \nA day later the storm \"exploded\" and became a global \nevent. Orbital measurements showed that this dust storm \nreduced the average temperature of the surface and \nraised the temperature of the atmosphere of Mars by 30 \n69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Bremen, Germany, 1-5 October 2018.  \nCopyright ©2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

The low density of the Martian atmosphere means \nthat winds of 18 to 22 m/s (65 to 79 km/h) are needed to \nlift dust from the surface, but since Mars is so dry, the \ndust can stay in the atmosphere far longer than on Earth, \nwhere it is soon washed out by rain. \nDuring the mid- 2007 a planet wide dust storm \nposed serious threat to the solar powered -Opportunity \nMars exploration rovers and Spirit. It blocked the path \nof sunlight thus reducing the amount of energy \ngenerated by the solar panels. This also resulted in \nshutting down of most science experiments as the \nscientists waited for the storms to clear. \nDust \nstorms \nare \nmost \ncommon \nduring \nperihelion(point in the orbit of a celestial body about the \nsun where the body comes closest to the sun) , when the \nplanet receives 40 percent more sunlight than during \naphelion (farthest point) . During aphelion water ice \nclouds form in the atmosphere, interacting with the dust \nparticles and affecting the temperature of the planet.  \nDust storms contribute to water loss on Mars. A \nstudy of dust storms with the Mars Reconnaissance \nOrbiter suggested that 10 percent of the water loss from \nMars may have been caused by dust storms. Instruments \non board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter detected \nobserved water vapour at very high altitudes during \nglobal dust storms. Ultraviolet light from the sun can \nthen break the water apart into hydrogen and oxygen. \nThe Hydrogen from the water molecule then escapes \ninto space.",
    "2. Methodology  \nThis paper aims at converting the Martian sand storms \nfor something which is very essential for human \nsettlement on mars, electricity. Following are the \nsuggestions for utilising a natural disaster to the fullest : \nThe first step is to use an air filter. To understand the \nbasic principle of air filter it is important to understand \nthe common collection mechanism at which the \nparticles get deposited on the fibre surface. One such \nmechanism is straining – particles getting stuck between \nthe clearances of two fibres due to its diameter.  \nAnother mechanism to consider is the impaction \nmechanism. It occurs when the inertia of a particle does \nnot allow it to follow the air streamlines and so the \nparticle impacts the fibre surface and leaves the air \nstream. \n Interception mechanism, on the other hand, occurs \nwhen a particle follows the streamline, but is attached to \nthe fibre surface owing to its diameter. For particles of 1 \nµm and smaller, it is bombarded by air molecules \n(Brownian motion) and is captured on the fibre surface \nby diffusion. \nThe impaction, interception and diffusion mechanisms \nare illustrated in Figure 5. \n \n \nFig. 5. The common  collection mechanism of particles \n \nSandstorms have a large amount of dust concentration \ntherefore depth filters should be used. Due to increased \ndust concentration, the surface pores will strain particles \nlarger \nthan \ntheir \ndiameter \nwhich \nmay \ncause \naccumulation of d0ust called dendrites (agglomerate of \ndust cake). This deposition impairs it from acting as a \ndepth filter and thus pre-filters should be used. \nPre-filters play an important role in allowing fibrous \nfilters to perform as depth filters. In fact, large particles \ncan be easily removed by means of a pre-filter. \nTherefore a combination of depth filter and pre filters \nshould be used for separating sand from the air.  \nAfter the sand gets separated, this clear air should be \nprojected on to the wind turbines or windmills. Wind \nturbines operate on a simple principle of converting one \nform of energy to another (conservation of energy). \nSince sandstorms have a high velocity, the energy of \nthis wind will turn two or three propeller blades which \nare fixed on to a rotor. The rotor is connected to the \nmain shaft, which then transfers this rotation to spin a \ngenerator to create electricity.  \nSo basically Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in \nthe wind into mechanical power. \n \nThe second technique that can be applied is using the \nsand collected from filters or using sand collectors to \ngenerate electricity. This process uses the technology of \nbucket elevator which has buckets attached to a \nconveyer belt. The buckets of the conveyor carries the \nsand to certain height which is 1/3 rd more height than \nfunnel which is the stock point of the sand. Sand from \nthe main funnel is then allowed to fall on the blades of \nthe sand wheel that is the basically a turbine which is \nused to generate power. This power is then stored in a \nDC battery. In short this phenomenon is based on the \nprinciple of conservation of energy as the sand moves \ndown from higher altitude to lower one in the bucket \nelevator where its potential energy is converted into \nkinetic energy. This motion is then converted into \ncircular motion in the sand wheel (turbine) and that \ncircular motion is converted into electricity by using a \nMini DC generator.  \n69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Bremen, Germany, 1-5 October 2018.  \nCopyright ©2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

As the missions turn out to be progressively \nmodern, the measure of information they can assemble and need to send to Earth is rapidly rising. Exchanging radio \nsignals between spacecraft in deep space is easier compared with getting those signals back to Earth, especially when \nthe spacecraft is 120 billion miles away. Despite the fact that we’ve sent spacecrafts billions of miles into space and \nrovers are gathering illuminating data about the planets, moons, and even asteroids, radio communication in space \nstill remains the new wilderness. While the missions themselves are a marvel of technical wizardry, so too is the \nHerculean feat of not simply conveying between spacecrafts but rather sending signals back to Earth. Man’s greatest \nachievement in this regard is the Voyager spacecraft, that 38 years later is still communicating with Earth from more \nthan 120 billion miles away, and has outlived even the most optimistic projections of longevity. NASA recently \ncelebrated the 25th anniversary of the last time Voyager sent its last images to Earth. Soon, it will be time when the \nVoyagers and other interstellar probes will send their last signal and will be lost in the intergalactic space. The deep \nspace data collected and sent back to Earth by the interstellar probes is extremely essential to mankind and possesses \nthe ability to answer questions that humans have been asking since decades. As more scientific questions arise, the \nability to answer them requires more sophisticated instruments that generate even more data which requires a \nproductive space communication arrangement which can be utilized by mankind for the upcoming years.

    "1. Introduction \nThe NASA Deep Space Network is a worldwide \nnetwork of U.S. spacecraft communication facilities that \nhelps to explore the farthest points of our solar system \nby performing radio and Radar astronomy operations. It \nhas three ground stations located approximately 120 \ndegrees apart on Earth in the United States (California), \nSpain (Madrid), and Australia (Canberra) which ensures \nthat any satellite in the deep space is able to \ncommunicate  with atleast one station at all times.

Each of these facility is situated in semi-\nmountainous, bowl-shaped terrain to help shield against \nradio frequency interference. \n \n \n \nFig.1. View from the Earth's north pole, showing the \nfield of view of the main DSN antenna locations. \n \nThe DSN supports NASA's scientific investigation \nof the Solar System and provides a two-way \ncommunication link that guides and controls various \nNASA unmanned interplanetary space probes, and \nbrings back the images and new scientific information \nthese probes collect. \nAll DSN antennas are steerable, high-gain, parabolic \nreflector antennas and these antennas and data delivery \nsystems make it possible to: \n \nacquire telemetry data from spacecraft. \n \ntransmit commands to spacecraft. \n \nupload software modifications to spacecraft. \n \ntrack spacecraft position and velocity. \n \nperform Very Long Baseline Interferometry \nobservations. \n \nmeasure variations in radio waves for radio \nscience experiments. \n \ngather science data. \n \nmonitor and control the performance of the \nnetwork. \n \n \nDeep space is defined in several different ways. \nAccording to a 1975 NASA report, the DSN was \ndesigned to communicate with the spacecrafts traveling \napproximately 16,000 km (10,000 miles) from Earth to \nthe farthest planets of the solar system. While The \nInternational Telecommunications Union, which sets \naside various frequency bands for deep space defines \n\"deep space\" to start at a distance of 2 million km from \nthe Earth's surface.",
    "1.1. History \nDSN was established in January 1958, when the Jet \nPropulsion Laboratory deployed radio tracking stations \nin Nigeria, Singapore and California to receive \ntelemetry and plot the orbit of the Army-launched \nExplorer 1, the first successful U.S. satellite. NASA was \nofficially established on October 1, 1958, to combine \nthe separately developing space-exploration programs \nof the US Army, US Navy, and US Air Force into one \ncivilian organization.  \nOn December 3, 1958, JPL was shifted from the US \nArmy to NASA and given responsibility for designing \nand executing lunar and planetary exploration programs \nusing remotely controlled spacecraft. Shortly after the \ntransfer, NASA established the concept of the Deep \nSpace Network as a separately managed and operated \ncommunications system that would accommodate all \ndeep space missions, thereby avoiding the need for each \nproject \nto \nhave \nits \nown \nspecialized \nspace \ncommunications network. The DSN \nwas \ngiven \nresponsibility for its own research, development, and \noperation in support of all of its users. Under this \nconcept, it has become a world leader in the \ndevelopment of low-noise receivers; large parabolic-\ndish antennas; tracking, telemetry, and command \nsystems; digital signal processing; and deep space \nnavigation. The Deep Space Network \nformally \nannounced its intention to send missions into deep space \nin the year 1963. From then it has remained in \ncontinuous operation.",
    "1.2. Antennas   \nAll the three deep-space communications facilities \nconsists of at least four deep space terminals equipped \nwith ultra-sensitive receiving systems and large \nparabolic-dish antennas. Which are: \n \nOne 34-meter (112 ft) diameter High \nEfficiency antenna (HEF). \n \nTwo or more 34-meter (112 ft) Beam \nwaveguide antennas (BWG) (three operational \nat the Goldstone Complex, two at the Robledo \nde Chavela complex (near Madrid), and two at \nthe Canberra Complex). \n \nOne 26-meter (85 ft) antenna. \n \nOne 70-meter (230 ft) antenna. \n \nFive of the 34-meter (112 ft) BWG antennas were \nadded to the system in the late 1990s. Three were \nlocated at Goldstone, and one each at Canberra and \nMadrid. A second 34-meter (112 ft) BWG antenna (the \nnetwork's sixth) was completed at the Madrid complex \nin 2004. \n69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Bremen, Germany, 1-5 October 2018.  \nCopyright ©2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Construction has also begun \non an additional antenna at the Madrid Deep Space \nCommunications Complex. By 2025, the 70 meter \nantennas at all three locations will be shut down and \nreplaced with 34 meter BWG antennas that will be \narrayed. All systems will be upgraded to have X-band \nuplink capabilities and both X and Ka-band downlink \ncapabilities.",
    "1.3. Current Signal Processing capabilities \nSince the beginning of the Voyager Interstellar \nMission in the early 1990’s, DSN capabilities have not \nsubstantially changed. However, advancements in \ndigital signal processing, arraying and error correction \nhave been done. Arraying of several antennas improved \nthe \ndata \nwhich \nreturned \nfrom \nVoyager \n2 Neptune encounter and was also used for the Galileo \nspacecraft. The DSN array currently available can link \nthe 70-meter (230 ft) dish antenna at the Deep Space \nNetwork complex in Goldstone, California, with an \nidentical antenna located in Australia, in addition to two \n34-meter (112 ft) antennas at the Canberra complex. \nCurrently the DSN can receive up to 4 spacecraft \nsignals at the same time, or MSPA-4 (Multiple \nSpacecraft per Aperture). However, apertures cannot \ncurrently be shared for uplink due to interference \neffects. \nAll the stations are remotely operated from a \ncentralized Signal Processing Center at each complex. \nThese Centers are equipped with electronic subsystems \nthat point and control the antennas, receive and process \nthe telemetry data, transmit commands, and generate the \nspacecraft navigation data. The processed data is then \ntransmitted to JPL for further processing and for \ndistribution \nto \nscience \nteams \nover \na \nmodern \ncommunications network.",
    "2. Methodology \nThis paper aims at providing solution for one of the \nmost crucial limitation of DSN. The term deep space \nnetwork is quite inappropriate as there are no current \nplans or future plans to set up communication satellites \nanywhere in space. All the equipments starting from \ntransmitter to the receiver are earth based due to which \nmulti mission use is impossible. \n  Therefore, data transmission rates from/to spacecrafts \nand space probes are severely constrained due to the \ndistances from Earth. \nSoon, it will be time when the Voyagers and other \ninterstellar probes will send their last signal and will be \nlost in the intergalactic space. The deep space data \ncollected and sent back to Earth by the interstellar \nprobes is extremely essential to mankind and possesses \nthe ability to answer questions that humans have been \nasking since decades. As more scientific questions arise, \nthe ability to answer them requires more sophisticated \ninstruments that generate even more data which requires \na productive space communication arrangement which \ncan be utilized by mankind for the upcoming years. \n \n \n \nFig.3. Voyager 1 entering the outer space \n  \nThus it is essential to set up a deep space network \nsuch that the signal does not get lost in the space. The \nbasic idea is to use a series of planets to transmit the \ndata back to the earth. This paper proposes to set up \nDSN on Pluto, Neptune and mars.

But beyond the mnemonics some of the most \nfascinating and unexplored objects lurk beyond the knowledge of textbooks in an icy region known as the Kuiper \nBelt. This area of our solar system has been providing astronomers with an avenue of mysteries to solve over the past \nfew years. The Kuiper-Edgeworth Belt is an area of the outer solar system that is estimated to stretch across 20 \nastronomical units (AU) of space. It is similar to the asteroid belt in appearance but physical characteristics differ \nwidely.

    "1. Introduction \nThe Kuiper or the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt, is a \ncircumstellar disc in the outer Solar System, extending \nfrom the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to approximately \n50 AU from the Sun. It is similar to the asteroid belt, but \nis 20 times wider and 20 to 200 times massive than the \nasteroid belt. It contains small bodies or remnants from \nwhen the solar system was formed. The Kuiper belt \nobjects are composed largely of frozen volatiles such as \nmethane, ammonia and water unlike the asteroids of the \nasteroid belt which contain rocks and metals. It is home \nto three officially recognized dwarf planets: Pluto, \nHaumea and Makemake. Knowing the composition of \nthe kuiper belt objects, this paper will propose a \ntechnique to utilise resources like ammonia and \nmethane present in the Kuiper belt for developing a re-\nfuelling system which would help scientists in \nsuccessful interstellar space missions. \n \n \n \nFig 1. Kuiper Belt",
    "1.1. History \nThe Kuiper belt was named after Dutch- American \nastronomer Gerard Kuiper, though he did not predict its \nexistence. In 1930, after Pluto was discovered, scientist \nspeculated that Pluto might not be alone. Later, inn the \nyear 1992, albion was discovered which was the direct \n69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Bremen, Germany, 1-5 October 2018.  \nCopyright ©2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \nIAC-18,D4,5,12,x46208  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 2 of 4 \nevidence for its existence. Albion was the first kuiper \nbelt object to be found after Pluto and Charon. Since its \ndiscovery, the number of known KBOs has increased to \nover a thousand, and more than 100,000 KBOs over 100 \nkm (62 mi) in diameter are thought to exist. The kuiper \nbelt was thought to be home from for the periodic \ncomets with orbits lasting less than 200 years. Studies \nsince the mid-1990s have shown that the kuiper belt is \ndynamically stable and that comets' true place of origin \nis the scattered disc, a dynamically active zone created \nby the outward motion of Neptune 4.5 billion years ago. \nThe largest member of the kuiper belt is Pluto and the \nsecond largest member is TNO.Originally considered a \nplanet, Pluto's status as part of the Kuiper belt caused it \nto be reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. Also, it’s \ncomposition is similar to many other objects of the \nKuiper belt.",
    "1.2. Structure \nThe Kuiper belt stretches from 30 to 55 AU. The \nmain body of the belt is generally accepted to extend \nfrom the 2:3 mean-motion resonance at 39.5 AU to the \n1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. When an object's \norbital period is an exact ratio of Neptune's (a situation \ncalled a mean-motion resonance), then it can become \nlocked in a synchronised motion with Neptune and \navoid being perturbed away if their relative alignments \nare appropriate. For instance, if an object orbits the Sun \ntwice for every three Neptune orbits, and reaches \nperihelion with Neptune a quarter of an orbit away from \nit, then whenever it returns to perihelion, Neptune will \nalways be in about the same relative position as it \nbegan, because it will have completed 1 1⁄2 orbits in the \nsame time. This is known as the 2:3 (or 3:2) resonance, \nand it corresponds to a characteristic semi-major axis of \nabout 39.4 AU. The Kuiper belt is thick, with the main \nconcentration extending about ten degrees outside the \necliptic plane. Thus it resembles a torus or doughnut and \nnot a belt. The presence of Neptune has serious effect \non the structure of the Kuiper belt due to orbital \nresonances. Over a time comparable to the age of the \nSolar System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits \nof objects that lie in nearby regions, and either sends \nthem into the inner Solar System or out into the \ninterstellar space. This has resulted to formation of gaps \nin the kuiper belt. For example, in the region between \n40-42 AU, no objects can retain a stable orbit. \n \n \nFig 2. Kuiper belt and orbital resonance",
    "1.3. Composition \nKuiper belt objects are thought to be unaffected by \nthe processes like gravitation because of its distance \nfrom the sun and major planets. Thus, determining their \ncomposition would provide information on how the \nsolar system was formed. Due to their small size and \nextreme distance from Earth it becomes difficult to \ndetermine \nits \nchemical \ncomposition. \nThus, \nthe \nastronomers determine the composition of such celestial \nobjects by spectroscopy. Different substances absorb \nlight at different wavelengths, and when the spectrum \nfor a specific object is unravelled, dark lines (called \nabsorption lines) appear where the substances within it \nhave absorbed that particular wavelength of light. Every \nelement or compound has its own unique spectroscopic \nsignature, and by reading an object's full spectral \n\"fingerprint\", \nastronomers \ncan \ndetermine \nits \ncomposition. According to the study, the kuiper belt \nobjects are composed of a mixture of rock and a variety \nof ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The \ntemperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so \ncompounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun \nremain solid in the belt. The densities and rock–ice \nfractions are known for only a small number of objects \nfor which the diameters and the masses have been \ndetermined. The diameter can be determined by imaging \nwith a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble \nSpace Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when \nan object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, \nby using the albedo of an object calculated from its \ninfrared emissions. The masses are determined using the \nsemi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are \ntherefore known only for a few binary objects. The \ndensities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The \nleast dense objects are thought to be largely composed \nof ice and have significant porosity. The densest objects \nare likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. \nThere is a trend of low densities for small objects and \nhigh densities for the largest objects. One possible \nexplanation for this trend is that ice was lost from the \nsurface layers when differentiated objects collided to \nform the largest objects.",
    "2. Methane and Ammonia \nStudies have concluded that the kuiper best has large \ncontent of frozen volatiles such as methane, ammonia \nand water. So, why not extract resources from kuiper \nbelt to utilise them for developing re-fuelling system? It \nwould help scientists in successful interstellar space \nmissions.  \n- SpaceX has successfully tested the Raptor engine \nwhich is staged combustion, methane-fueled rocket \nengine. This engine is powered by cryogenic liquid and \nliquid oxygen (LOX), rather than the RP-1 kerosene and \n69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Bremen, Germany, 1-5 October 2018.  \nCopyright ©2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \nIAC-18,D4,5,12,x46208  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 3 of 4 \nLOX used in all previous SpaceX Falcon rockets which \nuse Merlin 1C & D engines. The Raptor engine will \nhave two to three times the thrust of the Merlin 1D \nengine that powers the current Falcon 9 launch vehicle. \nThe broad Raptor concept as announced in 2013 was \"a \nhighly reusable methane staged-combustion engine that \nwill power the next generation of SpaceX launch \nvehicles designed for the exploration and colonization \nof Mars\".[ According to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, \nthis design was explicitly intended to achieve full \nreusability of all rocket stages and, as a result, \"a two \norder of magnitude reduction in the cost of spaceflight\". \nAlso, methane has great advantages over other fuels:  \n \n Methane VS hydrogen \nUsing methane + LOX (methalox) as propellant has \nmany advantages over traditional hydrogen + LOX \n(hydralox) launch systems. Hydrogen gives a higher \nspecific impulse (>400s), but all of the modifications \nrequired to deal with hydrogen negate that gain. As \nmethane is much denser than hydrogen, it requires much \nsmaller tanks than hydrogen for same amount of fuel \nwhich makes the overall design much lighter. Methane \nis more stable in space over long periods of time vs \nhydrolox, and doesn't need such highly insulated \ncryogenic tanks like hydrolox. It also has a boiling point \nmuch closer to that of oxygen, allowing a simple \nbulkhead design. Having a density closer to that of \noxygen allows for a simpler turbo pump (hydrolox is \nvery hard on a turbo pump). Higher thrust level helps \nfirst-stage get off the ground easier. In addition, liquid \nhydrogen \ncauses \nhydrogen \nembrittlement, \nwhere \nhydrogen atoms alloy themselves into their metal \ncontainers, and so weaken the structure. At high \npressures, this can be catastrophic.  \n \nMethane VS RP-1 \nMethane also has benefits over SpaceX's current fuel, \nRP-1. It can be manufactured on Mars by the Sabatier \nprocess. Methane also helps their reusability aims, as \nRP-1 creates a lot of carbon when it burns, choking up \nengines and slowing their reuse, whereas methane has \nno such problem. Methane burns hotter and is lighter \nthan kerosene, so it has a slightly higher specific \nimpulse than kerosene; an engine with the same \ncombustion pressure and efficiency will have a 10 \nsecond higher specific impulse when using methane \ninstead of kerosene. However, methane is a lot less \ndense than kerosene, which requires heavier tanks, \nwhich mostly offsets this increase in performance. Still, \nmethane is close to being an ideal \"best of both worlds \nfuel\" \n \n \n \nFig 3. First test firing of a Raptor development \nengine on 25 September 2016 in McGregor, Texas \n \n- Similarly ammonia has also been used as a \npropellant for XLR99. The Reaction Motors XLR99 \nengine was the first large, throttleable, restartable \nliquid-propellant rocket engine propelled by liquid \noxygen and anhydrous (water-free) ammonia. Its \ndevelopment began in the 1950s by the Reaction Motors \nDivision to power the North American X-15 hypersonic \nresearch aircraft. It could deliver up to 57,000 pounds \nforce (254 kN) of thrust). Thrust was variable from 50 \nto 100 percent, and the restart capability allowed it to be \nshut down and restarted during flight when necessary. It \nhad the following advantages: \nIn the gas phase 1 mole of NH3 occupies the same \nvolume as 1 mole of H2 but has 50% more hydrogen. \nEffectively it burns as hydrogen giving water plus \nnitrogen. \nThe \nnitrogen \nreduces \nproblems \nof \ncondensation during start-up. In addition it can be made \nliquid by moderate cooling or pressure, compared with \nthe very low temperatures or high pressures you need \nfor hydrogen. It has a higher octane rating than gasoline, \nbut only about half the energy per gallon. With liquid \noxygen it makes quite a good rocket fuel. \n \n \nFig 4. North American X-15",
    "3. Methodology \nVolatiles are basically the group of chemical \nelements or compounds with low boiling points and \nthese compounds in their solid state are often found in \nthe crusts of moons and planets in large proportions.  \nScientists often classify volatiles with exceptionally low \n69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Bremen, Germany, 1-5 October 2018.  \nCopyright ©2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. \nIAC-18,D4,5,12,x46208  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 4 of 4 \nmelting points, such as hydrogen and helium, as gases , \nwhereas those volatiles with melting points above about \n100 K (–173 °C, –280 °F) are referred to as ices. Proper \nmining techniques are yet to be found. Mining should be \ndone such that the effect of temperature and other \nfactors do not alter the properties of the compounds. As \nfar as locations of re-fuelling systems are considered the \nlagrangian points of Neptune are considered to be the \nbest. Lagrangian points are five areas in space where the \ngravitational pulls from two relatively massive bodies, \nsuch as Neptune and the sun, balance out. This allows \nbodies to remain stable and fixed in synch with the \nplanet's orbit, as they orbit the sun. At Neptune, the L4 \nand L5 regions are 60 degrees along the planet’s 360-\ndegree orbital path, ahead and behind the planet \nrespectively while L1, L2, L3 lie in straight ine in the \nlocation shown in the figure. In the position L4 and L5, \nbodies are able to collect and remain there which \nindicates that these points are very stable. Collecting \nmethane and ammonia from the Kuiper belt would be \ntricky, but not impossible. \n \n \n \nFig. 5. Neptune's Lagrangian points offer gravitational \nhavens",
